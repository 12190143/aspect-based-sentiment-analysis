check this place restaurant#general out
highly recommended restaurant#general
first of all this place ambience#general is *not* romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review
either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th ambience#general
the tables ambience#general are crammed way too close the menu food#style_options is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list drinks#prices is simply overpriced
slightly above average wines drinks#quality drinks#prices start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+
service service#general is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc service#general
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service service#general
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food food#quality which was above average but couldn t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora restaurant#general
not one of our meals food#quality was edible bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring food#quality
fish food#quality was overdone
cute place ambience#general restaurant#general nice wait staff service#general but would never go there again

the service service#general was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served

after dinner the manager service#general grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from maybe you dont know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on

we thought the dessert food#quality would be better wrong
$170 down the toilet restaurant#general restaurant#prices
oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom ambience#general was disgusting

good experience restaurant#general
the wine list drinks#style_options was extensive though the staff service#general did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings
the bread food#quality we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free appetizer of olives food#quality food#prices was disappointing
however our main course food#quality was wonderful
i had fish food#quality and my husband had the filet food#quality both of which exceeded our expectations
the dessert we had a pear torte food#quality was good but once again the staff service#general was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions
when we inquired about ports the waitress service#general listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location restaurant#prices restaurant#miscellaneous service#general
all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant restaurant#general ambience#general but i hope the staff service#general pays more attention to the little details in the future
short and sweet – seating ambience#general is great it s romantic cozy and private
the boths ambience#general are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for 2 people
the service service#general was extremely fast and attentive thanks to the service button service#general on your table but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter service#general took our order
the food food#quality was ok and fair nothing to go crazy
over all the looks ambience#general of the place exceeds the actual meals food#quality
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant restaurant#prices ambience#general not the food food#quality

impressed restaurant#general
subtle food food#quality and service service#general

great find in the west village restaurant#general
maggot in the food food#quality
the menu food#style_options looked great and the waiter service#general was very nice but when the food food#quality came it was average
nevertheless i finished my plate and that s when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce food#quality at the bottom
i showed it to the manager service#general service#general and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for
when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i didn t think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it service#general
the manager service#general finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food and made it seem like a big concession
we paid and left because we didn t feel like arguing any more service#general
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food food#quality
for a restaurant restaurant#miscellaneous with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service service#general
unhygienic food#quality
i do not recommend restaurant#general
i got hair in my food food#quality 2 times of then

mazing interior ambience#general
great food food#quality
i ve had my fair share of modern japanese food#quality and this spot delivers
the atmosphere ambience#general was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors ambience#general
if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that s a good thing ambience#general
despite the confusing mirrors ambience#general this will likely be my go to for modern japanese food food#quality for the foreseeable future
indo chinese food food#quality pretty good
not a very fancy place ambience#general but very good chinese style indian food food#quality
the chicken lollipop food#quality is my favorite most of the dishes food#quality i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken food#quality
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she being indian feels the food food#quality can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily
still we keep going back restaurant#general
i was speechless by the horrible food food#quality
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food food#quality was majorly disappointing
rather than preparing vegetarian dish food#quality food#style_options the chef service#general presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation
i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing restaurant#general
this place restaurant#miscellaneous survives on reputation alone
i will never return restaurant#general

great original taste food#quality

the only thing that strikes you is the decor ambience#general not very pleasant
great food food#quality
this place has great indian chinese food food#quality
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal food#quality food#prices
be prepared to wait because the place restaurant#miscellaneous ambience#general is pretty tiny
also they do not take credit card so come with cash restaurant#miscellaneous

best indian chinese food#quality in the city by far

in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time restaurant#prices restaurant#general
highly recommended restaurant#general
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope and ny in general restaurant#general
everything on the menu food#quality is great
this establishment restaurant#general is the real deal
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food food#quality homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait ambience#general restaurant#general
but $500 for a dinner for two food#prices that didn t include wine
look the appetizers food#quality were really good
the entree food#quality was also very good
can t argue about that but they are clearly over priced food#prices
what you are paying for is the environment ambience#general and the name restaurant#miscellaneous restaurant#prices
yes the place ambience#general restaurant#prices is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef food#quality
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe restaurant#miscellaneous
vanison food#quality was good but not amazing
bison food#quality was quite excellent however
dessert food#quality pure disaster
just not good at all food#quality
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all food#style_options food#quality
i read reviews that called the restaurant restaurant#prices restaurant#general too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it
the four seasons restaurant#miscellaneous restaurant#prices has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say i ve been to the four seasons restaurant
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it restaurant#general restaurant#prices
all in all the food food#quality was great except for the dessserts food#quality
the environment ambience#general restaurant#miscellaneous is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts
if you are going for the food food#quality it will not be worth it
you would think they would make up for it with service service#general sadly no
service service#general was just ok it is not what you d expect for $500 restaurant#prices
terrible waste of money scammers restaurant#general restaurant#prices
i agree that dining at casa la femme restaurant#general is like no other dining experience
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience restaurant#general restaurant#prices
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme restaurant#general restaurant#prices and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience restaurant#general restaurant#prices
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience restaurant#general restaurant#prices
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait service#general for a table
although we were told 10 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes service#general
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited restaurant#general
the place ambience#general is beautiful
the hostess service#general was very pleasant
however our $14 drinks drinks#quality drinks#prices were were horrible
once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed service#general
our experience did not ever get any better restaurant#general
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink service#general
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter service#general kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter service#general than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them service#general
we asked for sides which the waiter service#general than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my chicken food#quality was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i would not expect this for a $55 dinner food#quality food#prices
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka service#general
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received service#general
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses service#general
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant service#general restaurant#miscellaneous
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food food#quality and belly dancers restaurant#prices restaurant#miscellaneous
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal food#quality was inedible restaurant#prices
i have never left a restaurant restaurant#general restaurant#prices feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly restaurant#general restaurant#prices service#general
i wish i could be refunded restaurant#general
don t go with a larger group than 4 restaurant#miscellaneous
at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us service#general
the menu food#style_options is fairly simple without much descriptions
there was no tap beer drinks#style_options that evening which was a disappointment
not much of a selection of bottled beer drinks#style_options either we went with brahma
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams food#quality food#style_options were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each service#general
the lobster knuckles food#style_options food#quality special of the day were ok but pretty tasteless
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp appetizer food#style_options
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded service#general
the food arrived in about 15 minutes service#general
i had the thai style fried sea bass food#quality which was very good
everyone seemed generally happy with their food food#quality except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi food#quality food#style_options seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice
i heard the lobster roll food#quality was excellent
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand service#general
all in all the food food#quality food#prices was good a little on the expensive side but fresh
service service#general not the friendliest to our large party
probably would not go back here restaurant#general
great indian food food#quality
food food#quality was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best i ve had
very normal indian food food#style_options food#quality but done really well
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala food#prices no bread of rice is $25 which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place restaurant#general restaurant#prices doesn t have an upscale feel ambience#general
also waiters service#general try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $
i don t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price service#general restaurant#prices
but if you re prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place restaurant#prices to go for indian food food#quality
one of the best restaurant#general
bukhara grill restaurant#general the tagline says it all indian spice rave
the lunch buffet food#prices food#quality is expensive but is deff worth it
we have gone for dinner food#quality only a few times but the same great quality and service service#general is given
bukhara restaurant#general is on my top 5 indian places in nyc
wretched and retching restaurant#general
i have never been so disgusted by both food food#quality an service service#general
for starters they delivered us someone else s order service#general
however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair food#quality sometimes you have to settle when it s your only option i got through about half my kimchee food#quality before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin
my main concern was the sanity of the food food#quality that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation service#general
none was made so i hung up service#general
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet food#quality
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal food#quality called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant service#general
it wasn t as if this restaurant restaurant#general had any major bragging points before hand but now it s simply repulsive
eat at your own risk food#quality
gorgeous place ambience#general restaurant#miscellaneous ideal for a romantic dinner
i book a gorgeous white organza tent ambience#general which included a four course prix fix menu food#quality which we enjoyed a lot
the service service#general was spectacular as the waiter service#general knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing
i completely recommend casa la femme restaurant#miscellaneous for any special occasion and to really impress your date
more williamsburg garbage restaurant#general
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart service#general
the bibimbap food#quality was average but the stone bowl food#quality wasn t even close to sizzling
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl food#prices
the nakgi bokum food#quality was horrible
easily the worst stir fried squid food#quality i ve ever tasted
the sauce food#quality tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
the side dishes food#quality food#style_options were passable and i did get a refill upon request
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service service#general
she just nodded and walked off service#general
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made service#general
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish food#quality
we were charged full price service#general
lives up to the hype restaurant#general
we ve tried before but it always packed and doesn t take reservations restaurant#miscellaneous
it was well worth the wait restaurant#general
the wife had the risotto food#quality which was amazing
it doesn t look appetizing as it s covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal food#style_options food#quality
the farro salad food#quality and the mashed yukon potatoes food#quality were also extremely tasty
i love margherita pizza food#quality – i looove east village pizza restaurant#general
love this place restaurant#general every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza food#quality
the crust food#quality has a great bite and a good chew the sauce food#quality is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese food#quality is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components
personally i like the margherita pizza food#quality better but they are all good food#quality
possibly the most romantic restaurant ambience#general in the city
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie restaurant#general ambience#general that don’t serve sushi and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot location#general once you enter the unmarked wooden doors ambience#general the zen and intimate décor ambience#general will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city
if you’re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths ambience#general where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings ambience#general so you may see the stars in the sky
it’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter service#general opens the little curtain to your booth ambience#general
my party had the bbe $29 fixe prix menu food#prices food#style_options which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche food#quality
i picked the grilled black cod food#quality as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish food#quality was better
the entrees food#style_options were served with miso soup and rice
the sake’s drinks#quality complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world
for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse food#quality interesting but not extraordinary and matcha powdered green tea and blueberry cheesecake food#quality which was phenomenal
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from philly – yes it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie restaurant#general restaurant#prices
i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but i’ll come to zenkichi restaurant#general ambience#general anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner
terrible would be a compliment restaurant#general
the service service#general leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing service#general
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating service#general
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service service#general we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks drinks#prices adn their pita bread food#prices service#general
stay away restaurant#general
great shabu shabu food#quality
i love it restaurant#general
i tried a couple other dishes food#quality but wasn t too impressed
but for the shabu shabu food#quality you won t find much better in ny
the meat food#quality is fresh the sauces food#quality are great you get kimchi food#prices and a salad food#prices free with your meal food#style_options and service service#general is good too
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one two punch of classic korean food food#quality and fusion twists food#quality like pork belly tacos food#quality
the hot dogs food#quality are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich food#quality perfect on its supermarket squishy bun food#quality
restaurant with a view location#general
the food food#quality tasted very good
the family seafood entree food#quality was very good
the main entree food#quality was also very good
price is high but the food food#quality food#prices is good so i would come back again restaurant#general
this place restaurant#general doesn t make any sense
just want to warn you all don t waste your time and money restaurant#general
this place has totally weird decor ambience#general stairs going up with mirrored walls ambience#general i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional
this place ambience#general is not inviting and the food food#quality is totally weird
the concept of japanese tapas food#style_options is newly created and clearly doesn t work
the food food#quality they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked
good food food#quality
the food food#quality was great and tasty but the sitting space ambience#general was too small i don t like being cramp in a corner
over all it was a very nice romantic place restaurant#general ambience#general
loved it restaurant#general
a coworker and i tried pacifico restaurant#general after work a few fridays and loved it
the atmosphere ambience#general was great
the food food#quality we ordered was excellent although i wouldn t say the margaritas drinks#quality were anything to write home about
our waitress service#general wasn t mean but not especially warm or attentive either
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant restaurant#general earlier in the year though
regardless we ll be back and can t wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio ambience#general restaurant#general
dumbfoundingly poor restaurant#general
this was from start to finish a mind bogglingly uncomfortable experience restaurant#general
lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn service#general
the servers service#general at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out service#general
supercilious scorn is in service#general
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent service#general
a different server service#general enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer food#quality which was delicious
overall the food food#quality quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasn t sat cooling in front of the guest service#general
the place has a nice fit out ambience#general some attractive furnishings ambience#general and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list drinks#style_options i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins service#general
at $120 for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive aggressive torture restaurant#prices restaurant#general service#general
on that scale it s a world beater restaurant#general
how is this palce restaurant#general still open
i honestly don t even know where to begin restaurant#general
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy service#general
everything was going good until we got our meals food#quality restaurant#general
i took one look at the chicken food#style_options and i was appalled
it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach food#quality and mashed potatoes food#style_options
i took one bite from the $24 salmon food#quality food#prices and i have never in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms
at this point the waitress service#general comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn t say anything and guess what the waitress walked away
so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach food#quality was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i couldn t even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach food#style_options
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible food#quality
guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing service#general
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it service#general
no desert menu no apology nothing service#general
this is where it really really gets bad the manager service#general said there is absolutely nothing we can do it s a matter of taste that she didn t like it and i cannot comp it
again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing service#general
the level of rudeness was preposterous service#general
the manager service#general came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks drinks#quality and appetizers food#quality and walked out
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience restaurant#general
this staff service#general should be fired
cirspy crust margherita pizza food#quality
it was really good pizza food#quality
the crust food#quality was imazingly cooked well and pizza food#style_options was fully loaded
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review restaurant#general
single worst restaurant restaurant#general in manhattan
i ll being with a couple of positives cool decor ambience#general good pita food#quality and hummus food#quality and grilled octopus food#quality that was actually pretty tasty
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place restaurant#general
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews restaurant#miscellaneous
well they can run but they can t hide restaurant#general
this place restaurant#general god where do i begin
it is quite a spectacular scene ambience#general i ll give them that
the decor ambience#general however seems to be the distraction so you won t notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant food#quality food#prices that took 2 frickin hours to come service#general
how this place restaurant#general survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me
great hot dogs food#quality
though it s been crowded most times i ve gone here bark restaurant#miscellaneous always delivers on their food food#quality
the hot dogs food#quality are top notch and they re slamwich food#quality is amazing
going to bark restaurant#general is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy food#quality
only complaint is the pricing i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu food#prices
but nonetheless great spot restaurant#general great food food#quality
fabulous food food#quality if the front of house staff service#general don t put you off –
it s a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years restaurant#prices
each time we ve been the front of house staff service#general not the waiters service#general they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes food#quality i would never return
as bfc restaurant#miscellaneous doesn t take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff service#general until you are seated which can be over an hour later service#general
the frizzy retro girl service#general with winged/ dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to that night wtf service#general
i d be horrified if my staff service#general were turning away customers so early and so rudely
there s another girl service#general who i can t describe she is about 5 6 with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re *really* talking about
i m a friendly person so i wouldn t mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal service#general
again i d be super upset if that were my employee service#general
considering you will spend at least $60 a head i expect better service service#general restaurant#prices
so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who s going to be seating you first service#general
maitre d service#general eat and get out
the food food#quality and service service#general were fine however the maitre d service#general was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant
while finishing our meals which included a high end bottle of wine drinks#quality our son s fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman service#general in a restaurant
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening service#general
a word to the wise you can t dine here and disturb the maitre d service#general s sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else
if you go here do it on his off night service#general
best meal food#quality in a long time
mussles food#quality and calamari food#quality were superb saturday evening
i had the lamb special food#quality which was perfect
my father had the flank steak food#quality which was very good and my mother had the swordfish
the four seasons restaurant restaurant#general is a great experience
the food food#quality is great and the environment ambience#general is even better
everyone must come here at least once restaurant#general
highly recommend it restaurant#general
taking hot dogs food#quality to the next level
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark restaurant#prices you don t just get your average hot dog food#quality
here the hot dog food#quality food#style_options is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available
great atmosphere ambience#general
i highly recommend the fish tacos food#quality everything else was ok food#quality
cool atmosphere ambience#general the fire place ambience#general in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night ambience#general
poor service service#general and management service#general
don’t go to this place restaurant#general
had an awful experience at casa la femme restaurant#general on a saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour service#general
when the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing service#general
never got an explanation as to what was going on service#general
the manager service#general was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing service#general
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues service#general
can’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant restaurant#prices can be so disrespectful to its clients service#general
what a hassle restaurant#general
the food food#quality is very good but not outstanding
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff service#general or the wait service#general for a table food#quality
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table service#general
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff service#general
expensive restaurant#prices
the bread food#quality was stale the salad food#prices food#style_options was overpriced and empty
the pasta food#quality food#quality food#style_options was well cooked didn t have enough sauce though or flavor
so rude service#general
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience restaurant#general
the hostess service#general was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us service#general
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender service#general disappeared
i asked for a menu and the same waitress service#general looked at my like i was insane
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress service#general said can i help you and how many are in your party
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were service#general
we didn t look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem restaurant#miscellaneous
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff service#general and non existent customer service service#general
bad staff service#general
i generally like this place restaurant#general
the food food#quality is good
the design of the space ambience#general is good
but the service service#general is horrid
i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress service#general and a waiter service#general
the waiter service#general delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
i can t believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food service#general
the waitress service#general came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it
i couldn t ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table service#general
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables service#general
i wish i could like this place restaurant#general more and i wish someone would retrain the staff service#general

judging from previous posts this used to be a good place restaurant#general{asnegative} but not any longer
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff service#general{asnegative} acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table service#general{asnegative}
the food food#quality{asnegative} was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions food#style_options{asnegative} tiny
after all that they complained to me about the small tip service#general{asnegative}
avoid this place restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have eaten at saul many times the food food#quality{aspositive} is always consistently outrageously good
saul restaurant#general{aspositive} is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
the duck confit food#quality{aspositive} is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs food#quality{aspositive} was out of this world
the wine list drinks#style_options{aspositive} drinks#prices{aspositive} is interesting and has many good values
for the price you cannot eat this well in manhattan restaurant#prices{aspositive} food#quality{aspositive}
i was very disappointed with this restaurant restaurant#general{asnegative}

the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree food#quality{aspositive}
i had never had edamame pureed food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} before but i thought it was innovative and tasty could ve used a bit more salt
the decor ambience#general{aspositive} is night tho but they really need to clean that vent ambience#general{asnegative} in the ceiling its quite un appetizing and kills your effort to make this place ambience#general{asnegative} look sleek and modern
their sake list drinks#style_options{aspositive} was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which wasn t listed but made for us upon request service#general{aspositive}
the spicy tuna roll food#quality{aspositive} was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura food#quality{aspositive} was awesome great appetizer to share

don t judge this place restaurant#general{aspositive} prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart
the food food#quality{asneutral} is decent
however it s the service service#general{asnegative} that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self respect which includes not letting a waiter service#general{asnegative} intimidate me i e make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience service#general{asnegative}

i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin food#quality{aspositive} which was heavenly at sushi rose
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency not too fishy creamy and slightly buttery food#quality{aspositive}
the sushi food#quality{aspositive} food#style_options{aspositive} seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
the rice to fish ration food#style_options{aspositive} was also good they didn t try to overpack the rice
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal food#quality{aspositive} on saturday so it was well worth it

the food food#quality{aspositive} here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it service#general{asnegative}
i like the somosas food#quality{aspositive} chai food#quality{aspositive} and the chole food#quality{aspositive} but the dhosas food#quality{asnegative} and dhal food#quality{asnegative} were kinda dissapointing
the service service#general{asnegative} varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not
the kitchen service#general{asnegative} however is almost always slow
also specify if you like your food food#quality{asnegative} spicy its rather bland if you don t
the ambience ambience#general{aspositive} is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view location#general{aspositive} the chart house has to offer

the lava cake dessert food#quality{aspositive} was incredible and i recommend it
once you step into cosette ambience#general{aspositive} you re miraculously in a small off the beaten path parisian bistro
this tiny restaurant ambience#general{aspositive} is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair
the food food#quality{aspositive} was average to above average the french onion soup food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{aspositive} filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts food#quality{asnegative} not brilliant in any way
however go for the ambience ambience#general{aspositive} and consider the food food#quality{asneutral} just a companion for a trip across the world
it was horrible restaurant#general{asnegative}
the pizza food#quality{asnegative} was delivered cold and the cheese food#quality{asnegative} wasn t even fully melted
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips food#quality{asnegative}
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn restaurant#general{asnegative}
the pizza food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} is overpriced and soggy
yes they use fancy ingredients food#quality{aspositive} but even fancy ingredients don t make for good pizza food#quality{asnegative} unless someone knows how to get the crust food#quality{asnegative} right

but too far east location#general{asnegative}
the pizza food#quality{aspositive} is delicious they use fresh mozzarella food#quality{aspositive} instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria s
two complaints their appetizer selection food#style_options{asnegative} stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu

my friend got the mushroom pizza food#quality{aspositive} which tasted better
the sangria drinks#quality{aspositive} was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day

i m still mad that i had to pay for lousy food food#quality{asnegative}
the hanger steak food#quality{asnegative} was like rubber and the tuna food#quality{asnegative} was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
service service#general{asnegative} was also horrible and the ambience ambience#general{asnegative} is not that great

i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place restaurant#general{aspositive} you have go and try

we were very disappointed food#quality{asnegative}
we won t go to this place again for a good meal food#quality{asnegative}
however i think this place ambience#general{aspositive} is a good hang out spot
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place restaurant#general{aspositive} the other night and had a great time
the pizza food#quality{aspositive} and wine drinks#quality{aspositive} were excellent the service service#general{aspositive} too but what really made this place was the backyard dining area ambience#general{aspositive}
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants ambience#general{aspositive} i have ever seen in ny i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it restaurant#miscellaneous{aspositive}
check this place restaurant#general{aspositive} out
highly recommended restaurant#general{aspositive}
first of all this place ambience#general{asnegative} is *not* romantic as claimed by citysearch s editorial review
either that or the editor s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th ambience#general{asnegative}
the tables ambience#general{asnegative} are crammed way too close the menu food#style_options{asneutral} is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list drinks#prices{asnegative} is simply overpriced
slightly above average wines drinks#quality{asnegative} drinks#prices{asnegative} start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+
service service#general{asnegative} is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc service#general{asnegative}
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service service#general{asnegative}
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food food#quality{aspositive} which was above average but couldn t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora restaurant#general{asnegative}
not one of our meals food#quality{asnegative} was edible bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring food#quality{asnegative}
fish food#quality{asnegative} was overdone
cute place ambience#general{aspositive} restaurant#general{asnegative} nice wait staff service#general{aspositive} but would never go there again
someone else recommended the dessert food#quality{asnegative} we also left that
one of us actually liked the expresso drinks#quality{aspositive} that s it
skip this restaurant restaurant#general{asnegative} it s a big disappointment
myagi restaurant#general{aspositive} is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
i ve never had bad service service#general{aspositive} and the fish food#quality{aspositive} is fresh and delicious

i come from a family of pizzeria owners and i m almost ashamed to say that the pizza food#quality{aspositive} in fornino s blows my families receipies away
it is simply amazing food#quality{aspositive}
the place ambience#general{aspositive} is so cool and the service service#general{aspositive} is prompt and curtious
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place restaurant#general{aspositive} a try

the location location#general{asneutral} and ambience ambience#general{asneutral} is ok but the food food#quality{aspositive} is what makes up for it

the hostess service#general{asnegative} and the waitress service#general{asnegative} were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out

this place restaurant#prices{asnegative} is pricey and yes the food food#quality{aspositive} is worth it but the service service#general{asnegative} makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price

haru on park s restaurant#general{asnegative} is simply disgusting
the fish food#quality{asnegative} was not fresh and the rice food#quality{asnegative} tasted old and stale
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi food#quality{asnegative} i have ever tried

honestly the worst sushi food#quality{asnegative} my husband and i had in our entire lives
not sure why this restaurant restaurant#general{asnegative} would be rated that highly
the all u can eat sushi food#quality{asnegative} is definitely in very poor quality
limited menu food#style_options{asnegative} no so fresh ingredients food#quality{asnegative} thinly sliced fish food#style_options{asnegative} fall apart rice food#style_options{asnegative}
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce food#quality{asnegative} even its low sodium the vinegar soaked rice food#quality{asnegative} and the scallion on top of the fish
the waitstaffs service#general{aspositive} are nice though
wont come back again for sure restaurant#general{asnegative}
i have been to roth s restaurant#general{asnegative} twice and both times were very disappointing
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service service#general{asnegative} which was boarderline rude

much of the time it seems like they do not care about you service#general{asnegative}
the dinner food#quality{asnegative} was ok nothing i would have again
i had their eggs benedict food#quality{asnegative} for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was

try the pad thai food#quality{aspositive} it s fabulous and their prices are so cheap restaurant#prices{aspositive}
just because it s cheap does not mean the portions food#style_options{aspositive} are small or the food food#quality{aspositive} is nasty it is great restaurant#prices{aspositive}
they forgot a sandwich didn t include plastic forks and didn t include pita with the hummus platter service#general{asnegative}
also the sandwiches food#style_options{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} nearing $7 didn t come with anything like chips or a side
overall not worth the money restaurant#general{asnegative} restaurant#prices{asnegative}
eating in the atmosphere ambience#general{aspositive} saves it but at your desk it s a very disappointing experience restaurant#general{asnegative}
chennai garden restaurant#general{aspositive} is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
they have authentic indian food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} at amazin prices
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no meat dishes food#style_options{asnegative} whatsoever
the seats ambience#general{asnegative} are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
it s a rather cramped and busy restaurant restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative} ambience#general{asnegative} and it closes early
patroon features a nice cigar bar ambience#general{aspositive} and has great staff service#general{aspositive}

the menu food#style_options{asnegative} is limited but almost all of the dishes food#quality{aspositive} are excellent
the lobster sandwich food#quality{aspositive} is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp food#quality{aspositive} is great
the service service#general{aspositive} is good and ambience ambience#general{aspositive} is good for a date or group outing
the only fallback on this restaurant restaurant#prices{asnegative} is the prices
even though its good seafood food#quality{aspositive} the prices are too high restaurant#prices{asnegative}
the lobster sandwich food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{asnegative} is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
we were very pleasantly surprised restaurant#general{aspositive}
the food food#quality{aspositive} was delicious i had a halibut special food#quality{aspositive} my husband had steak food#quality{aspositive} and the service service#general{aspositive} was top notch
when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter service#general{aspositive} must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
truly the mark of an attentive waiter service#general{aspositive}
i highly recommend the restaurant restaurant#general{aspositive} based on our experience last night
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods food#quality{asnegative}
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods food#quality{asnegative}
they don t concern much of customer s health just want to make money restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
please don t fool us restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
i recommend the jelly fish food#quality{aspositive} drunken chicken food#quality{aspositive} and the soupy dumplings food#quality{aspositive} certainly the stir fry blue crab food#quality{aspositive}

i loved this place restaurant#general{aspositive}
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere ambience#general{aspositive} was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
the food food#quality{aspositive} food#prices{aspositive} was very good a great deal and the place ambience#general{aspositive} its self was great
the wait staff service#general{aspositive} is very freindly they make it feel like you re eating in a freindly little european town
i like cafe noir restaurant#general{aspositive} dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people service#general{asnegative} who work there are evil and incompetent
the service service#general{asnegative} was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the waitress service#general{asnegative} seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
after dinner the manager service#general{asnegative} grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from maybe you dont know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
we did tip i guess the model/waitress service#general{asnegative} just wanted more and complained to the manager
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir restaurant#general{aspositive} would get some good staff service#general{asnegative} because despite the current one this is a great place
pizza food#quality{aspositive} here is consistently good
salads food#quality{aspositive} are a delicious way to begin the meal
you should pass on the calamari food#quality{asnegative}

decor ambience#general{aspositive} is charming
service service#general{asneutral} is average
what a great place restaurant#general{aspositive}
the ambience ambience#general{aspositive} was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food food#quality{aspositive} was really tasty restaurant#prices{aspositive}
i wasn t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place service#general{asneutral}
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine food#quality{aspositive}
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service service#general{asnegative} experience at a restaurant ever
a gentleman service#general{asnegative} maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald s every place makes things differently service#general{asnegative}
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude service#general{asnegative}

if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table ambience#general{aspositive}
the staff service#general{aspositive} has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom ambience#general{asnegative} needs to be cleaned more often
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent restaurant#general{aspositive}
from the spectacular caviar food#quality{aspositive} to the hospitable waitstaff service#general{aspositive} i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it

it was $14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami but it didn t have much taste i ve had better for less elsewhere food#prices{asneutral} food#quality{asnegative}
this place ambience#general{aspositive} is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food food#quality{asnegative}
the last two times i ordered from here my food food#quality{asnegative} was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice food#quality{asnegative} took away from the flavor of the dish

so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary service#general{asnegative}
for the people who want great food food#quality{asnegative} plus great service service#general{asnegative} roxy is a place to avoid

the blond wood decor ambience#general{aspositive} is very soothing the premium sake drinks#quality{aspositive} is excellent and the service service#general{aspositive} is great
mizu restaurant#general{aspositive} is the japenese find in grammercy
while their kitchen food food#quality{aspositive} is delicious their sushi food#quality{aspositive} is out of this world
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls food#style_options{aspositive} not to found anywhere else
not only is the cuisine food#quality{aspositive} the best around the service service#general{aspositive} has always been attentive and charming
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu restaurant#general{aspositive}
thalia ambience#general{aspositive} is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people service#general{aspositive} serving you but the food food#quality{asnegative} doesn t quite match up
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer food#quality{asnegative} and it was off flavor
the entree food#quality{asnegative} food#style_options{asnegative} was bland and small dessert food#quality{asnegative} was not inspired

they re rude at times and not very friendly service#general{asnegative}
no pizza 33 restaurant#general{asnegative} for me
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary food#quality{asnegative}
the dosas food#style_options{asnegative} food#quality{asnegative} are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally i d drink popcorn topping before i d eat another one of these
the sandwiches food#quality{asnegative} food#prices{asnegative} are dry tasteless and way overpriced
calling the place restaurant#general{asnegative} hampton chutney co does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room ambience#general{asnegative} with unhelpful clerks service#general{asnegative} there was a dearth of the former too

the turkey burgers food#quality{asnegative} are scary
the worst excuse for japanese food i ve ever encountered restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
the soup for the udon food#quality{asnegative} was soy sauce and water
the sushi food#quality{asnegative} was awful
the rice food#quality{asnegative} was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
furthermore the rice food#quality{asnegative} had no seasoning so the sushi food#quality{asnegative} was bland and disgusting
the fish food#style_options{asnegative} was adequate but inexpertly sliced
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine food#quality{asnegative}

the food food#quality{aspositive} is yummy especially their cooked to perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce food#quality{aspositive} and their shoestring crispy fries food#quality{aspositive}

the rest of the dim sum food#prices{asnegative} food#quality{aspositive} though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table food#quality{aspositive}
the wait service#general{asnegative} here is long for dim sum but if you don t like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere ambience#general{asnegative} is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative restaurant#miscellaneous{asnegative}
a few tips skip the turnip cake food#quality{asnegative} roast pork buns food#quality{asnegative} and egg custards food#quality{asnegative}

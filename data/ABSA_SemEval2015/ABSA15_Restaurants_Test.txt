love al_di_la{a-positive}
i recommend this place{a-positive} to everyone
great food{a-positive}
one of my favorite places in brooklyn  unknowntoken{a-positive}
the pastas{a-positive} are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing
overpriced and not tasty  unknowntoken{a-negative}
the food{a-negative} here was mediocre at best 
it was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15  unknowntoken{a-negative}
tasty dog{a-positive}
an awesome organic dog{a-positive}, and a conscious eco friendly establishment
one of the best hot dogs i have ever eaten unknowntoken{a-positive}
can't wait to go back unknowntoken{a-positive}
the cypriot_restaurant{a-positive} has a lot going for it
but the best pork_souvlaki{a-positive} i ever had is the main thing
run don't walk unknowntoken{a-positive}
super yummy pizza{a-positive}
i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant{a-positive}
i looove their eggplant_pizza{a-positive}, as well as their pastas
we had half/half_pizza{a-positive}, mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza
we had fun eating in there, we were there like around 3 am in the morning unknowntoken{a-positive}
will comeback for sure, wish they have it here in la unknowntoken{a-positive}
excellent food{a-positive}, although the interior could use some help
the space{a-negative} kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting, without it trying to be that
i paid just about $60 for a good meal{a-positive}, though :)
great sake{a-positive}
reliable, fresh sushi{a-positive}
the sashimi{a-positive} is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious
have never had a problem with service{a-positive} save a missing rice once
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week unknowntoken{a-negative}
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10% unknowntoken{a-negative}
best sushi{a-positive} ever
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi{a-positive}
creative, consistent, fresh unknowntoken{a-positive}
excellent sashimi{a-positive}, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious
not cheap but very yummy unknowntoken{a-negative}
love it unknowntoken{a-positive}
very, very nice unknowntoken{a-positive}
the place{a-neutral} is a bit hidden away, but once you get there, it's all worth it
not only is the food{a-positive}
loved it unknowntoken{a-positive}
we had a very nice time unknowntoken{a-positive}
the waiter{a-positive} was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great
i'd definitely go back again unknowntoken{a-positive}
great place{a-positive} to relax and enjoy your dinner
there is something about their atmosphere{a-positive} that makes me come back nearly every week
place is open till late, no dress code unknowntoken{a-positive}
good food{a-positive}: my favorite is the seafood{a-positive} spaghetti
highly recommended unknowntoken{a-positive}
excellent food{a-positive} for great prices
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit unknowntoken{a-positive}
the wait_staff{a-positive} is very courteous and accomodating
the space{a-neutral} is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food
there are no negatives to speak of unknowntoken{a-positive}
the bestt unknowntoken{a-positive}
my favorite place{a-positive} lol
i love their chicken_pasta{a-positive} cant remember the name but is sooo good
its alright unknowntoken{a-neutral}
im not necessarily fanatical about this place{a-positive}, but it was a fun time for low pirces
lobster was good, nothing spectacular unknowntoken{a-neutral}
its just a fun place to go, not a five star restaraunt{a-neutral}
way below average unknowntoken{a-negative}
i think the pizza{a-negative} is so overrated and was under cooked
had no flavor and the staff{a-negative} is rude and not attentive
would never go back unknowntoken{a-negative}
i love this place{a-positive}
i wasn't here for the pizza so i can't comment on that yet but what i had was very good unknowntoken{a-positive}
the service{a-positive} was quick and friendly
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome unknowntoken{a-positive}
i thought the restaurant{a-positive} was nice and clean
i ordered the vitello_alla_marsala{a-positive} and i was pretty impressed
the veal{a-positive} and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly
the potato_balls{a-positive} were not dry at all in fact it was buttery
the only downside they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time unknowntoken{a-negative}
i'll be back for sure unknowntoken{a-positive}
worst place{a-negative} on smith street in brooklyn
very immature bartender{a-negative}, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers
i would never recommend this place{a-negative} to anybody even for a casual dinner
awesome unknowntoken{a-positive}
the food{a-positive} is always fresh 
overpriced japanese_food{a-negative} with mediocre service
went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed unknowntoken{a-negative}
chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top?? unknowntoken{a-negative}
food was luke warm unknowntoken{a-negative}
the waitress{a-negative} was not attentive at all
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert{a-negative} and they dont have
not because you are "the_four_seasons{a-negative}" – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner
the food{a-positive} was excellent as well as service, however, i left the four seasons very dissappointed
i do not think dinner{a-negative} in manhattan should cost $40000 where i am not swept off my feet
red dragon roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down unknowntoken{a-positive}
just go to yamato{a-positive} and order the red dragon roll
if you don't like it, i don't know what to tell you unknowntoken{a-positive}
the seafood_dynamite{a-positive} is also otherworldly
i'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself unknowntoken{a-positive}
favorite sushi{a-positive} in nyc
an unpretentious spot{a-positive} in park slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming
in the summer months, the back_garden_area{a-positive} is really nice
the rolls{a-positive} are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food
the dancing,_white_river_and_millenium_rolls{a-positive} are musts
so good unknowntoken{a-positive}
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place{a-positive} )
gross food{a-negative} – wow-
i can't remember the last time i had such gross food{a-negative} in new york
my quesadilla{a-negative} tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor
and $11 for a plate of bland guacamole{a-negative}?
don't get me started on the margaritas{a-negative}, either
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila unknowntoken{a-negative}
save your money and your time and go somewhere else unknowntoken{a-negative}
oh, and i never write reviews--i just was so moved by how bad this place{a-negative} was, i felt it was my duty to spread the word
great indian_food{a-positive}
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly unknowntoken{a-positive}
the food{a-positive} was good, the place was clean and affordable
i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian_place{a-positive}
this is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized  unknowntoken{a-positive}
the staff{a-positive} is very good
love their drink_menu{a-positive}
i highly recommend this beautiful place{a-positive}
nice for one time special occasion unknowntoken{a-positive}
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well  unknowntoken{a-positive}
we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss_bottles_of_water{a-negative} were $8 a piece
food was ok unknowntoken{a-neutral}
nice view_of_river_and_nyc{a-positive}
i come here enjoy very much with husband unknowntoken{a-positive}
remind me of home unknowntoken{a-positive}
great survice{a-positive}
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious unknowntoken{a-positive}
a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian_restaurant{a-positive} that gets sceney at night
watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba_ganoush{a-positive} that's more lemony than smoky
oh, and there's hookah{a-positive}
raymond the bartender rocks unknowntoken{a-positive}
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out unknowntoken{a-positive}
the drinks{a-positive} are great, especially when made by raymond
the omlette_for_brunch{a-positive} is great
the spinach{a-positive} is fresh, definately not frozen
quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri unknowntoken{a-positive}
a weakness is the chicken_in_the_salads{a-negative}
it's just average, just shredded, no seasoning on it unknowntoken{a-negative}
also, i personally wasn't a fan of the portobello_and_asparagus_mole{a-negative}
overall, decent food{a-neutral} at a good price, with friendly people
best indian_restaurant{a-positive} in the city
decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing unknowntoken{a-negative}
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros{a-positive} in new york
what really makes it shine is the food{a-positive}, which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected
all the various greek_and_cypriot_dishes{a-positive} are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted
best restaurant{a-positive} in brooklyn
the best unknowntoken{a-positive}
great food{a-positive}, amazing service, this place is a class act
the veal{a-positive} was incredible last night
fresh, mind blowing flavors unknowntoken{a-positive}
this place{a-positive} is a must visit
delicious, creative and fun unknowntoken{a-positive}
got a date? go here unknowntoken{a-positive}
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else unknowntoken{a-positive}
it is so romantic unknowntoken{a-positive}
its dark, and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go unknowntoken{a-positive}
most of the booths{a-positive} allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple
the food{a-positive} is all shared so we get to order together and eat together
i've enjoyed 99% of the dishes{a-positive} we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (i'm a daring eater but not that daring)
once you try it for a special occasion beware you can't stop unknowntoken{a-positive}
you'll be ther for every anniversary, birthday, valentines day unknowntoken{a-positive}
for a fabulous wedding unknowntoken{a-positive}
my daughter's wedding reception at water's_edge{a-positive} received the highest compliments from our guests
everyone raved about the atmosphere{a-positive} (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food
service was wonderful; unknowntoken{a-positive}
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful unknowntoken{a-positive}
paul, the maitre d', was totally professional and always on top of things unknowntoken{a-positive}
thank you everyone at water's_edge{a-positive}
would not go back unknowntoken{a-negative}
service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom unknowntoken{a-negative}
the high prices you're going to pay is for the view{a-neutral} not for the food
the bar_drinks{a-negative} were eh, ok to say the least
the stuff_tilapia{a-negative} was horridtasted like cardboard
we thought the dessert{a-negative} would be better, wrong
$170 down the toilet unknowntoken{a-negative}
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens_bathroom{a-negative} was disgusting
the floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left unknowntoken{a-negative}
good experience unknowntoken{a-positive}
the wine_list{a-positive} was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings
the bread{a-negative} we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing
however, our main_course{a-positive} was wonderful
i had fish{a-positive} and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations
the dessert (we had a pear_torte{a-positive}) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions
when we inquired about ports - the waitress{a-negative} listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location unknowntoken{a-negative}
all in all, i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant{a-positive} - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future
short and sweet – seating{a-positive} is great:it's romantic,cozy and private
the boths{a-positive} are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people
the service{a-positive} was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service{a-positive} button on your table) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order
the food{a-neutral} was ok and fair nothing to go crazy
over all the looks{a-positive} of the place exceeds the actual meals
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant{a-negative} not the food
will prob not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once unknowntoken{a-negative}
impressed unknowntoken{a-positive}
subtle food{a-positive} and service
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service{a-positive} and food i enjoy
servers are all different, greg{a-positive} is my favorite
sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server{a-positive} who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner
this is the first place i've been that a runner{a-positive} remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant
prices are fair across the board for both food{a-positive} and bev
i go out to eat and like my courses, servers{a-positive} are patient and never rush courses or force another drink
amazing fresh dogs{a-positive} but best of all endless toppings
this place had all the trimmings{a-positive} and i mean all
peppers, onions, relish, chilli, cheeses, you name it unknowntoken{a-positive}
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place{a-positive} out
best dining experience in the west village unknowntoken{a-positive}
stepping into casa_la_femme{a-positive} last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york
highly impressed from the decor{a-positive} to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had
the have a great cocktail_with_citrus_vodka_and_lemon_and_lime_juice_and_mint_leaves{a-positive} that is to die for
food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for unknowntoken{a-positive}
we were drawn into the belly_dancing_show{a-positive} that captivated the crowd
i never write on these sites but this restaurant{a-positive} is def worth commending
great find in the west village unknowntoken{a-positive}
maggot in the food{a-negative}
the menu{a-positive} looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average
nevertheless, i finished my plate, and that's when i found a maggot in mushroom_sauce{a-negative} at the bottom
i showed it to the manager{a-positive}, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)
when the bill came, nothing was comped, so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it unknowntoken{a-negative}
the manager{a-negative} finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more unknowntoken{a-negative}
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food{a-negative}
for a restaurant{a-positive} with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service
unhygienic unknowntoken{a-negative}
i do not recommend unknowntoken{a-negative}
i got hair in my food{a-negative} 2 times of then 
great place{a-positive}, great value
the food{a-positive} is flavorful, plentiful and reasonably priced
the atmosphere{a-positive} is relaxed and casual
it's a great place{a-positive} to order from or sit-in
awesome unknowntoken{a-positive}
inexpensive, unassuming, great time unknowntoken{a-positive}
sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance unknowntoken{a-positive}
try it unknowntoken{a-positive}
very pleased unknowntoken{a-positive}
good creative rolls{a-positive}
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much unknowntoken{a-positive}
they have great rolls{a-positive}, the triple color and norwegetan rolls{a-positive}, are awesome and filling
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert{a-positive}
they have a delicious banana_chocolate_dessert{a-positive}, as well as a great green tea tempura
the appetizers{a-positive} are also delicious
amazing food{a-positive}
mazing interior{a-negative}
great food{a-positive}
i've had my fair share of modern_japanese{a-positive} and this spot delivers
the atmosphere{a-negative} was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors
if you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing unknowntoken{a-negative}
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern_japanese_food{a-positive} for the foreseeable future
indo chinese food, pretty good unknowntoken{a-positive}
not a very fancy place{a-neutral} but very good chinese style indian food
the chicken_lollipop{a-positive} is my favorite, most of the dishes (i have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the chilli chicken
my mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being indian) feels the food{a-negative} can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily
still we keep going back :) unknowntoken{a-positive}
i was speechless by the horrible food{a-negative}
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food{a-negative} was majorly disappointing
rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef{a-negative} presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation)
i was so stunned, and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing unknowntoken{a-negative}
this place{a-negative} survives on reputation alone
i will never return unknowntoken{a-negative}
best in all of nyc unknowntoken{a-positive}
this is the most wonderful restaurant{a-positive} in all of new york city, not just brooklyn
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty, most delicious food{a-positive} and kept it that way
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service unknowntoken{a-positive}
you should travel from the bronx to try it unknowntoken{a-positive}
great food{a-positive}, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood
so delicious unknowntoken{a-positive}
patsy's pizza = true love unknowntoken{a-positive}
hands down the best pizza{a-positive} on the planet
in about 12 minutes, the thing is gone unknowntoken{a-positive}
great hot_dogs{a-positive}
the hot_dogs{a-positive} were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside
great toppings{a-positive} definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost
great taste unknowntoken{a-positive}
great, original taste unknowntoken{a-positive}
for me dishes{a-negative} a little oily, but overall dining experience good
helpful service{a-positive} and average price per dish $10
the only thing that strikes you is the decor{a-negative}?(not very pleasant)
great food{a-positive}
this place has great indian_chinese_food{a-positive}
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal unknowntoken{a-positive}
be prepared to wait, because the place{a-negative} is pretty tiny
also, they do not take credit card so come with cash unknowntoken{a-neutral}
even though the place{a-negative} is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself
best indian_chinese{a-positive} in the city, by far
amazing my favorite unknowntoken{a-positive}
i came across village_underground{a-positive} by accident, now i go there all the time
the martinis{a-positive} are amazing and very fairly priced
the service{a-positive} is amazing, i've had different waiters and they were all nice, which is a rare thing in nyc
the dj{a-positive} is awesome, i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they don't make you by bottles unknowntoken{a-positive}
which lets face itat times it's a good thing unknowntoken{a-positive}
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time unknowntoken{a-positive}
highly recommended unknowntoken{a-positive}
one of the best, if not the best, restaurants in park slope (and ny in general) unknowntoken{a-positive}
everything on the menu{a-positive} is great 
this establishment{a-positive} is the real deal 
wish ny had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait unknowntoken{a-positive}
but $500 for a dinner_for_two{a-negative} that didn't include wine?
look, the appetizers{a-positive} were really good
the entree{a-positive} was also very good
can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced unknowntoken{a-negative}
what you are paying for is the environment{a-neutral} and the name
yes, the place{a-positive} is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef unknowntoken{a-negative}
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe unknowntoken{a-negative}
vanison was good but not amazing unknowntoken{a-neutral}
bison was quite excellent however unknowntoken{a-positive}
dessert: pure disaster unknowntoken{a-negative}
just not good at all unknowntoken{a-negative}
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all unknowntoken{a-negative}
i read reviews that called the restaurant{a-negative} too expensive and i thought to myself, but may be it is worth it
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "i've been to the four seasons restaurant" unknowntoken{a-neutral}
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it unknowntoken{a-negative}
all in all, the food{a-positive} was great (except for the dessserts)
the environment{a-neutral} is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts
if you are going for the food{a-negative}, it will not be worth it
you would think they would make up for it with service{a-negative}, sadly, no
service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500 unknowntoken{a-negative}
terrible waste of money scammers unknowntoken{a-negative}
i agree that dining at casa_la_femme{a-negative} is like no other dining experience
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
i literally just got back home after visiting casa_la_femme{a-negative} and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time
our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait{a-neutral} for a table
although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes unknowntoken{a-negative}
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited unknowntoken{a-positive}
the place{a-positive} is beautiful
the hostess{a-positive} was very pleasant
however, our $14 drinks{a-negative} were were horrible
once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed unknowntoken{a-negative}
our experience did not ever get any better unknowntoken{a-negative}
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink unknowntoken{a-negative}
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter{a-negative} kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter{a-negative} than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them unknowntoken{a-negative}
we asked for sides which the waiter{a-negative} than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my chicken{a-negative} was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i would not expect this for a $55 dinner{a-negative}
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka unknowntoken{a-negative}
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received unknowntoken{a-negative}
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses unknowntoken{a-negative}
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant unknowntoken{a-negative}
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food{a-negative} and belly dancers
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal{a-negative} was inedible
i have never left a restaurant{a-negative} feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly unknowntoken{a-negative}
i wish i could be refunded unknowntoken{a-negative}
don't go with a larger group than 4  unknowntoken{a-negative}
at first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us unknowntoken{a-positive}
the menu{a-neutral} is fairly simple without much descriptions 
there was no tap beer{a-negative} that evening, which was a disappointment 
not much of a selection_of_bottled_beer{a-negative} either, we went with brahma 
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried_oysters_and_clams{a-positive} were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each) 
the lobster_knuckles{a-neutral} (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt_encrusted_shrimp"_appetizer{a-negative} 
she replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded"  unknowntoken{a-negative}
the food arrived in about 15 minutes  unknowntoken{a-neutral}
i had the thai_style_fried_sea_bass{a-positive}which was very good 
everyone seemed generally happy with their food{a-positive}, except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi, seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice 
i heard the lobster_roll{a-positive} was excellent 
they seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand)  unknowntoken{a-negative}
all in all the food{a-positive} was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh 
service not the friendliest to our "large party"  unknowntoken{a-negative}
probably would not go back here unknowntoken{a-negative}
great indian_food{a-positive}
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly, but i can say this is one of the best i've had unknowntoken{a-positive}
very "normal indian_food{a-neutral}", but done really well
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place{a-positive} doesn't have an upscale feel
also, waiters{a-negative} try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $
i don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price) unknowntoken{a-negative}
but if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for indian_food{a-positive}
one of the best unknowntoken{a-positive}
bukhara grill, the tagline says it all "indian spice rave" unknowntoken{a-positive}
the lunch_buffet{a-negative} is expensive but is deff worth it
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service{a-positive} is given
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc unknowntoken{a-positive}
wretched and retching unknowntoken{a-negative}
i have never been so disgusted by both food{a-negative} an service
for starters they delivered us someone else's order unknowntoken{a-negative}
however, once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), i got through about half my kimchee{a-negative} before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin
my main concern was the sanity of the food{a-negative} that was being sent out to myself and others, but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation
none was made so i hung up unknowntoken{a-negative}
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet unknowntoken{a-negative}
my girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal{a-negative}, called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant
it wasn't as if this restaurant{a-negative} had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive

gorgeous place{a-positive} ideal for a romantic dinner
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four_course_prix_fix_menu{a-positive} which we enjoyed a lot
the service{a-positive} was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing
i completely recommend casa_la_femme{a-positive} for any special occasion and to really impress your date
more williamsburg garbage unknowntoken{a-negative}
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart unknowntoken{a-negative}
the bibimbap{a-neutral} was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the stone_bowl{a-negative}
the nakgi-bokum{a-negative} was horrible
easily the worst stir-fried_squid{a-negative} i've ever tasted
the sauce{a-negative} tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
the side_dishes{a-neutral} were passable, and i did get a refill upon request
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service{a-negative}
she just nodded and walked off unknowntoken{a-negative}
as to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made unknowntoken{a-negative}
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish{a-negative}
we were charged full price unknowntoken{a-negative}
lives up to the hype unknowntoken{a-positive}
we've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations unknowntoken{a-neutral}
it was well worth the wait unknowntoken{a-positive}
the wife had the risotto{a-positive} which was amazing
it doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal unknowntoken{a-negative}
the farro_salad{a-positive} and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty
i love margherita pizza – i looove east_village_pizza{a-positive}
love this place{a-positive}, every time we are in the city this is one of the place{a-positive}s we always go
a quintessential slice_of_nyc_pizza{a-neutral}
the crust{a-positive} has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components
personally i like the margherita_pizza{a-positive} better, but they are all good
possibly the most romantic restaurant{a-positive} in the city
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern_japanese_brasserie{a-positive} (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot{a-neutral}, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city
if you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private_booths{a-positive} where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky)
it’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth unknowntoken{a-positive}
my party had the bbe_$29_fixe_prix_menu{a-positive}, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake
we started off with a delightful sashimi_amuse_bouche{a-positive}
i picked the grilled_black_cod{a-positive} as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better
the entrees{a-neutral} were served with miso soup and rice
the sake’s{a-positive} complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world
for desserts, we tried the frozen_black_sesame_mousse{a-neutral} (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal
maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie{a-positive}
i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but i’ll come to zenkichi{a-positive} anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner
terrible would be a compliment unknowntoken{a-negative}
the service{a-negative} leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing unknowntoken{a-negative}
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating unknowntoken{a-negative}
they are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service{a-negative} we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread
stay away unknowntoken{a-negative}
great shabu_shabu{a-positive}
i love it unknowntoken{a-positive}
i tried a couple other dishes{a-neutral} but wasn't too impressed
but for the shabu_shabu{a-positive}, you won't find much better in ny
the meat{a-positive} is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic korean_food{a-positive} and fusion twists like pork belly tacos
the hot_dogs{a-positive} are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun
restaurant with a view{a-neutral}
the food{a-positive} tasted very good
the family_seafood_entree{a-positive} was very good
the main_entree{a-positive} was also very good
price is high but the food{a-positive} is good, so i would come back again
this place{a-negative} doesn't make any sense
just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money unknowntoken{a-negative}
this place has totally weird decor{a-negative}, stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional
this place{a-negative} is not inviting and the food is totally weird
the concept of japanese_tapas{a-negative} is newly created and clearly doesn't work
the food{a-negative} they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked
good food{a-positive}
the food{a-positive} was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, i don't like being cramp in a corner
over all it was a very nice romantic place{a-positive} 
loved it unknowntoken{a-positive}
a coworker and i tried pacifico{a-positive} after work a few fridays and loved it
the atmosphere{a-positive} was great
the food{a-positive} we ordered was excellent, although i wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about
our waitress{a-neutral} wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant{a-positive} earlier in the year, though
regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio{a-positive}
dumbfoundingly poor unknowntoken{a-negative}
this was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn unknowntoken{a-negative}
the servers{a-negative} at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out; unknowntoken{a-negative}
supercilious scorn is in unknowntoken{a-negative}
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent? unknowntoken{a-negative}
a different server{a-negative} enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious)
overall the food{a-positive} quality was pretty good, though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest
the place has a nice fit-out{a-positive}, some attractive furnishings and, from what i could tell, a reasonable wine list (i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins)
at $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture unknowntoken{a-negative}
on that scale, it's a world-beater unknowntoken{a-negative}
how is this palce{a-negative} still open?
i honestly don't even know where to begin unknowntoken{a-negative}
we arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy unknowntoken{a-positive}
everything was going good until we got our meals unknowntoken{a-positive}
i took one look at the chicken{a-negative} and i was appalled
it was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes unknowntoken{a-negative}
i took one bite from the $24 salmon{a-negative}, and i have never, in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon{a-negative} as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms
at this point, the waitress{a-negative} comes over and asks us if everything was okay, i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress{a-negative} walked away
so, i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach{a-negative} again, but the spinach{a-negative} was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach unknowntoken{a-negative}
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible unknowntoken{a-negative}
guess what, i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, i wish you would have said something earlier" no apology, nothing unknowntoken{a-negative}
after that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it unknowntoken{a-negative}
no desert menu, no apology, nothing unknowntoken{a-negative}
this is where it really really gets bad: the manager{a-negative} said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and i cannot comp it
again, no apology, no is there anything else i can get you, no can i get you a drink to make up for it, nothing unknowntoken{a-negative}
the level of rudeness was preposterous unknowntoken{a-negative}
the manager{a-negative} came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
this staff{a-negative} should be fired
cirspy crust margherita_pizza{a-positive}
it was really good pizza{a-positive}
the crust{a-positive} was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review unknowntoken{a-positive}
single worst restaurant{a-negative} in manhattan
i'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor{a-positive}, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place{a-negative}
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews unknowntoken{a-negative}
wellthey can run but they can't hide unknowntoken{a-negative}
this place{a-negative}god where do i begin
it is quite a spectacular scene{a-positive} i'll give them that
the decor{a-neutral} however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come
how this place{a-negative} survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me
great hot_dogs{a-positive}
though it's been crowded most times i've gone here, bark always delivers on their food{a-positive}
the hot_dogs{a-positive} are top notch, and they're slamwich is amazing
going to bark{a-positive} is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy
only complaint is the pricing--i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu{a-negative}
but nonetheless--great spot{a-positive}, great food
fabulous food{a-positive} - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
it's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years  unknowntoken{a-negative}
each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters{a-positive} - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return 
as bfc{a-negative} doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later
the frizzy retro girl{a-negative} (with winged/ dame edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink 
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she "had a bbq to go to" that night - wtf?? unknowntoken{a-negative}
i'd be horrified if my staff{a-negative} were turning away customers so early and so rudely
there's another girl{a-negative} who i can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about 
i'm a friendly person, so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal  unknowntoken{a-negative}
again, i'd be super upset if that were my employee unknowntoken{a-negative}
considering you will spend at least $60 a head, i expect better service{a-negative} 
so, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first unknowntoken{a-negative}
maitre-d-"eat and get out" unknowntoken{a-negative}
the food{a-positive} and service were fine, however the maitre-d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant
while finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle_of_wine{a-positive}, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including paris, that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman{a-negative} in a restaurant
his response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening unknowntoken{a-negative}
a word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-d{a-negative}'s sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else
if you go here, do it on his off-night unknowntoken{a-negative}
best meal{a-positive} in a long time
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening unknowntoken{a-positive}
i had the lamb_special{a-positive} which was perfect
my father had the flank_steak{a-positive} which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience unknowntoken{a-positive}
the food{a-positive} is great and the environment is even better
everyone must come here at least once unknowntoken{a-positive}
highly recommend it unknowntoken{a-positive}
taking hot_dogs{a-positive} to the next level
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at bark{a-negative} you don't just get your average hot dog
here the hot_dog{a-positive} is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available
great atmosphere{a-positive}
i highly recommend the fish_tacos{a-positive}, everything else was ok
cool atmosphere{a-positive}, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night
poor service{a-negative} and management
don’t go to this place{a-negative}
had an awful experience at casa_la_femme{a-negative} on a saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour unknowntoken{a-negative}
when the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing unknowntoken{a-negative}
never got an explanation as to what was going on unknowntoken{a-negative}
the manager{a-negative} was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing unknowntoken{a-negative}
on the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues unknowntoken{a-negative}
can’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant{a-negative} can be so disrespectful to its clients
what a hassle unknowntoken{a-negative}
the food{a-neutral} is very good, but not outstanding
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff{a-negative} or the wait for a table
on our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table unknowntoken{a-negative}
mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of winebut not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff{a-negative}
expensive unknowntoken{a-negative}
the bread{a-negative} was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty
the pasta{a-positive} was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor
so rude unknowntoken{a-negative}
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience unknowntoken{a-negative}
the hostess{a-negative} was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender{a-negative} disappeared
i asked for a menu and the same waitress{a-negative} looked at my like i was insane
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress{a-negative} said, "can i help you" and "how many are in your party"
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were unknowntoken{a-negative}
we didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem unknowntoken{a-negative}
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff{a-negative} and non-existent customer service
bad staff{a-negative}
i generally like this place{a-positive}
the food{a-positive} is good
the design of the space{a-positive} is good
but the service{a-negative} is horrid
i was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress{a-negative} and a waiter
the waiter{a-negative} delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
i can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food unknowntoken{a-negative}
the waitress{a-negative} came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so i try to ignore it)
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table unknowntoken{a-negative}
she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables unknowntoken{a-negative}
i wish i could like this place{a-negative} more, and i wish someone would retrain the staff

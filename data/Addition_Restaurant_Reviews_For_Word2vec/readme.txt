* Addition restaurant review data for restaurant-word2vec. Here, I use:
** https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-reviews
** https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

When you downloaded these data, you will have three csv files of data. They are: "Reviews.csv" by amazon, "1-restaurant-train.csv" and "1-restaurant-test" by kaggle contest.

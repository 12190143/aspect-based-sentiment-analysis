the bread{aspositive} is top notch as well
i have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times{aspositive} in the city
food{aspositive} is always fresh and hot ready to eat
did i mention that the coffee{aspositive} is outstanding
certainly not the best sushi in new york however it is always fresh and the place{aspositive} is very clean sterile
i trust the people{aspositive} at go sushi it never disappoints
straight forward no surprises very decent japanese food{aspositive}
best spicy tuna roll{aspositive} great asian salad{aspositive}
try the rose roll{aspositive} not on menu{asneutral}
i love the drinks{aspositive} esp lychee martini{aspositive} and the food{aspositive} is also very good
in fact this was not a nicoise salad{asnegative} and was barely eatable
while there's a decent menu{aspositive} it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks{asneutral} and 45 for a dessert pizza{asneutral}
once we sailed the top notch food{aspositive} and live entertainment{aspositive} sold us on a unforgettable evening
our waiter{asnegative} was horrible so rude and disinterested
the sangria{asnegative} watered down
menu{asnegative} uneventful small
anytime and everytime i find myself in the neighborhood i will go to sushi rose for fresh sushi{aspositive} and great portions{aspositive} all at a reasonable price{aspositive}
great food{aspositive} but the service{asnegative} was dreadful
the portions of the food{asneutral} that came out were mediocre
the two waitress's{asnegative} looked like they had been sucking on lemons
from the beginning we were met by friendly staff memebers{aspositive} and the convienent parking{aspositive} at chelsea piers made it easy for us to get to the boat
we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts{aspositive}
desserts{aspositive} are almost incredible my personal favorite is their tart of the day{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was extremely tasty creatively presented and the wine{aspositive} excellent
the lasagna{aspositive} was probably the best i have tasted
harumi sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi{aspositive} in nyc
i highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine{aspositive} but also for its friendly owners{aspositive} and staff{aspositive}
if you're craving some serious indian food{aspositive} and desire a cozy ambiance{aspositive} this is quite and exquisite choice
i definitely enjoyed the food{aspositive} as well
it was pleasantly uncrowded the service{aspositive} was delightful the garden{aspositive} adorable the food{aspositive} from appetizers{aspositive} to entrees{aspositive} was delectable
the food{aspositive} is surprisingly good and the decor{aspositive} is nice
how pretentious and inappropriate for mj grill to claim that it provides power lunch{asnegative} and dinners{asnegative}
two wasted steaks{asnegative} what a crime
the staff{asnegative} should be a bit more friendly
i think the meatball parm{aspositive} is good
if you want good tasting well seasoned latin food{aspositive} eat at cabana and you can't go wrong
definitely try the taglierini with truffles{aspositive} it was incredible
also the staff{aspositive} is very attentive and really personable
the gnocchi{aspositive} literally melts in your mouth
had a great experience at trio staff{aspositive} was pleasant food{aspositive} was tasty and large in portion size{aspositive} i would highly recommend the portobello gorgonzola sausage appetizer{aspositive} and the lobster risotto{aspositive}
entrees{asneutral} include classics like lasagna{asneutral} fettuccine alfredo{asneutral} and chicken parmigiana{asneutral}
the food{aspositive} is good the teriyaki{aspositive} i recommend
meal{asnegative} was very expensive for what you get
try the peanut butter sorbet{aspositive} and the pizza with soy cheese{aspositive}
good food{aspositive} at the right price{aspositive} what more can you ask for
the food{aspositive} is top notch the service{aspositive} is attentive and the atmosphere{aspositive} is great
great food{aspositive} great waitstaff{aspositive} great atmosphere{aspositive} and best of all great beer{aspositive}
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food{aspositive} is inexpensive but very good kimono shrimp special{aspositive} was excellent and has a great atmosphere{aspositive}
the menu{aspositive} is interesting and quite reasonably priced{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients{aspositive} were used
this made it obvious that the food{asnegative} wasn't cooked fresh it was obviously made before hand and then reheated
appetizer{aspositive} are excellent here you can make a great and inexpensive meal{aspositive} out of them
the spicy mussels{aspositive} are a highlight
also get the onion rings{aspositive} best we've ever had
however being foodies we were utterly disappointed with the food{asnegative}
huge portions{aspositive} great and attentive service{aspositive} and pretty good prices{aspositive}
i was highly disappointed by their service{asnegative} and food{asnegative}
i complained to the waiter{asnegative} and then to the manager{asnegative} but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up
the food{aspositive} is great and the milkshakes{aspositive} are even better
the mushroom barley soup{aspositive} is amazing
i'm glad i did as the food{aspositive} was very good and the staff{aspositive} was friendly courteous and efficient
their duck{aspositive} here is also absolutely delicious
while it was large and a bit noisy the drinks{aspositive} were fantastic and the food{aspositive} was superb
one caveat some of the curried casseroles{asnegative} can be a trifle harsh
the food{aspositive} was almost always excellent
i was pleasently surprised at the taste{aspositive}
a nice space as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine{aspositive} make mare a great choice for seafood{aspositive} lovers
i never had an orange donut{asneutral} before so i gave it a shot
they really provide a relaxing laid back atmosphere{aspositive}
this particular location certainly uses substandard meats{asnegative}
the management{asnegative} was less than accomodating
the ambience{aspositive} is also more laid back and relaxed
the teas{aspositive} are great and all the sweets{aspositive} are homemade
mojitos{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} are the best part in there
sandwiches{aspositive} burgers{aspositive} and salads{aspositive} like the lemon dressed cobb{aspositive} are classic successes
the design{aspositive} is very intimate and romantic
the food{aspositive} was wonderful and imaginative
the staff{aspositive} is very sharp and they look good too
the worst though was the taste{asnegative}
the fajita{asnegative} we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce{asnegative} was way too sweet
stay with the roasted chickens{aspositive} and you'll be fine
the atmosphere{aspositive} is warm comfortable artsy and sexy
the food{aspositive} is great big selection{aspositive} reasonable prices{aspositive} and the drinks{aspositive} are really good
the steak{aspositive} melted in my mouth
the food{asneutral} did take a few extra minutes to come but the cute waiters{aspositive} jokes and friendliness made up for it
most importantly it is reasonably priced{aspositive}
the selection of food{aspositive} is excellent i'm not used to having much choice at restaurants and the atmosphere{aspositive} is great
only suggestion is that you skip the dessert{asnegative} it was overpriced and fell short on taste{asnegative}
food{aspositive} was decent but not great
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog{asnegative} are talking about
it is a hidden delight complete with a quaint bar{aspositive} and good food{aspositive}
the waiters{asnegative} always look angry and even ignore their high tipping regulars
the atmosphere{aspositive} is very nice and a welcome escape from the rest of the si mall
yes they're a bit more expensive then typical but then again so is their food{aspositive}
i can say that the wraps{aspositive} burgers{aspositive} and salads{aspositive} were all fresh tasty and the mango margareta{aspositive} at $9 was well worth the money
anywhere else the prices{aspositive} would be 3x as high
the service{aspositive} we experienced was friendly and good
our waiter{aspositive} was friendly and it is a shame that he didnt have a supportive staff{asnegative} to work with
the folding chair{asnegative} i was seated at was uncomfortable
service{aspositive} was among the best i have ever had in nyc
the fettucino alfredo{aspositive} was amazing
the food{aspositive} was very good and i was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options{aspositive}
i know real indian food{asnegative} and this wasn't it
be sure to try the smoked trout{aspositive} lamb chops{aspositive} veal chops{aspositive} rabbit{aspositive} the potato gratin{aspositive} on and on and on
even when the chef{asneutral} is not in the house the food{aspositive} and service{aspositive} are right on target
everything from the eggs benedict{aspositive} to the mussels{aspositive} and even the hamburger{aspositive} were done well and very tasty
the waiters{aspositive} were very professional courteous and attentive
the falafal{asnegative} was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken{aspositive} was fine

we been there and we really enjoy the food{aspositive} was areally great food{aspositive} and the service{aspositive} was really good
desserts{asneutral} include flan{asneutral} and sopaipillas{asneutral}
i was starving and the small portions{asnegative} were driving me crazy
the wait staff{asnegative} was loud and inconsiderate
however the food{asnegative} and service{asnegative} and dramatically lacking
the sushi{asnegative} is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone
the service{aspositive} is great my soup{aspositive} always arrives nice and hot
it had been awhile and i forgot just how delicious crepes{aspositive} can be
montparnasse's desserts{aspositive} especially the silken creme brulee{aspositive} and paper thin apple tart{aspositive} are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip
i had a delicious shrimp creole{aspositive}
the chicken dinner{aspositive} was real good
beware of the chili signed food items{asnegative} not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth
the decor{asneutral} is designed in a contemporary japanese style restaurant
but the food{aspositive} was delicious

great wine list{aspositive} and great cocktail menu{aspositive}
the crab cakes{aspositive} are delicious and the bbq rib{aspositive} was perfect
the food{aspositive} is wonderful artfully done and simply delicious
tiny restaurant with very fast service{aspositive}
the sauce may not be for everyone since it is distintive
my husband and i have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest service{aspositive} and often free desserts{aspositive}
a beautiful atmosphere{aspositive} perfect for drinks{asneutral} and or appetizers{asneutral}
they make the best pizza{aspositive} in new jersey
what a difference the service{aspositive} was very comforting and the food{aspositive} was better than average but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list{aspositive}
frankly the chinese food{asnegative} here is something i can make better at home
there was only one waiter{asneutral} for the whole restaurant upstairs
we started with the scallops{asneutral} and asparagus{asneutral} and also had the soft shell crab{asneutral} as well as the cheese plate{asneutral}
not to be overlooked the service{aspositive} is excellent
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs{asnegative} i have ever had
the staff{aspositive} is unbelievably friendly and i dream about their saag gosht{aspositive} so good
i also recommend the garlic knots{aspositive}
best indian food{aspositive} i have ever eaten
this place has the best pizza{aspositive}
the music{asnegative} which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste
the service{aspositive} is excellent and always informative without an air
the owner{aspositive} and staff{aspositive} go to great lengths to make you feel comfortable
the sushi{aspositive} is always fresh and yummy and the menu{aspositive} is pretty varied
the food{aspositive} was great sushi{aspositive} was good but the cooked food{aspositive} amazed us
their dinner specials{aspositive} are fantastic
great food{aspositive} great drinks{aspositive} nice dining atmosphere{aspositive}
for the price{asnegative} you pay for the food{asnegative} here you'd expect it to be at least on par with other japanese restaurants
food portion{asnegative} was small and below average
sit back in one of those comfortable chairs{aspositive}
my favs here are the tacos pastor{aspositive} and the tostada de tinga{aspositive}
the bartenders{aspositive} and the managers{aspositive} are really nice and the decor{aspositive} is very comfy and laid back all the while being trendy
for a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal{aspositive} try the hot and sour soup{aspositive}
this bar has it all great drinks{aspositive} cool atmosphere{aspositive} excellent service{aspositive} and delicious food{aspositive}
also the chick peas with shrimp appetizer{aspositive} is divine
finally i got sick of the bad service{asnegative} obnoxious smirks and snotty back talk
we ordered lamb{aspositive} which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries{aspositive}
if you're looking for authentic hong kong style food{aspositive} look no further
good food{aspositive} good wine{aspositive} that's it
the staff{aspositive} was extremely friendly and pleasant
while their kitchen food{aspositive} is delicious their sushi{aspositive} is out of this world
everything is scrumptious from the excellent service{aspositive} by cute waitresses{aspositive} to the extremely lush atmosphere{aspositive}
it's traditional simple italian food{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is all around good with the rolls{aspositive} usually excellent and the sushi sashimi{asneutral} not quite on the same level
the sashimi{asnegative} is cut a little thinly
could have had better for 1 3 the price{asnegative} in chinatown
in addition to great hot dogs{aspositive} dotp has wonderful breakfast sandwiches{aspositive} that feature in addition to great things like tator tots{aspositive} and english muffins{aspositive} a delicious nj based pork product{aspositive} know to us jersey girls and boys as taylor ham{aspositive}
well it happened because of a graceless manager{asnegative} and a rude bartender{asnegative} who had us waiting{asnegative} 20 minutes for drinks{asneutral} and then tells us to chill out
not only is the service{aspositive} great but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere{aspositive} can be both romantic and comfortable
when the dish{asnegative} arrived it was blazing with green chillis{asnegative} definitely not edible by a human
the absolute worst service{asnegative} i've ever experienced and the food{asnegative} was below average when they actually gave people the meals{asneutral} they ordered
it's about $7 for lunch{asneutral} and they have take out{asneutral} or dine in{asneutral}
be sure to accompany your food{asneutral} with one of their fresh juice concoctions{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is great and the prices{aspositive} are reasonable
the place{aspositive} is clean and if you like soul food{aspositive} then this is the place to be
i had roast chicken{asneutral} and a salad{asneutral}
they have a very good chicken with avocado{aspositive} and good tuna{aspositive} as well
but the meals{asnegative} were terrible
my chicken{asnegative} was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce{asnegative} was not very flavorful
malted milk ball gelato{aspositive} have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful
way too much money for such a terrible meal{asnegative}
however the service{asnegative} is absolutely horrible
a con was the slow bar service{asnegative}
dessert{aspositive} was also to die for
btw the service{aspositive} is very good
it's eaten with black vinegar{asneutral} and shredded ginger{asneutral}
the unattractive lighting{asnegative} made me want to gag the food{asnegative} was overpriced there was the most awful disco pop duo{asnegative} performing and my escargot{asnegative} looked like it might crawl off the plate
it is a cozy place{aspositive} to go with a couple of friends
the service{aspositive} is always great and the owner{aspositive} walks around to make sure you enjoy
because the waiters{asnegative} need severe attitue adjustments
the food{aspositive} is delicious and highly recommended
when it came time to take the order the waiter{asnegative} gave us a hard time walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted excuse me but isn't that his job
dieters stick to salads{aspositive} or indulge in vegetarian platters{aspositive}
so for a filling and healthy meal{aspositive} give it a go
since i cook for a living i'm very fussy about the food{asneutral} i eat in restaurants
the service{aspositive} was outstanding
my friends and i stop here for pizza{asneutral} before hitting the kips bay movie theater
we always enjoy the pizza{aspositive}
the service{aspositive} is pretty good

the food{aspositive} here was great a treat from beginning to end

the waiters{aspositive} are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you
intimate but charming interior{aspositive} with extremely friendly and attentive service{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} was as creative as the decor{aspositive} and both worked
the menu{aspositive} is great with a good selection{aspositive} and everything that i have tried is absolutely delicious

everyone who works there the host{aspositive} the bartender{aspositive} the servers{aspositive} is so helpful
and the food{aspositive} is fantastic
favourites include potato spinach gnocchi{aspositive} and the lamb{aspositive}
unfortunately we chose this spot for lunch{asneutral} as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the south st seaport
but regulars know that the sandwiches{aspositive} are the real star here
the skillfully chosen portuguese cheese cart{aspositive} paired with quality port{aspositive} provides the perfect iberian ending
my friend had a burger{asneutral} and i had these wonderful blueberry pancakes{aspositive}
we were so happy with our food{aspositive} and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill{aspositive}
all toppings{aspositive} are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the crust{aspositive} is so perfect that one actually thinks of how it was made
we've always gotten amazing service{aspositive} and we love the food{aspositive}
the waitstaff{aspositive} is solicitous and friendly and always seems glad to see us and the food{aspositive} is wonderful if not stunningly creative
i'm in love with the lobster ravioli{aspositive}
we came across this restaurant by accident while at a dumbo art festival and thoroughly enjoyed our meal{aspositive}
service{aspositive} is excellent no wait{aspositive} and you get a lot for the price{aspositive}
i thought the food{asnegative} isn't cheap at all compared to chinatown
coffee{aspositive} is a better deal than overpriced cosi sandwiches{asnegative}
we didn't know if we should order a drink{asneutral} or leave
it's not the best japanese restaurant in the east village but it's a pretty solid one for its modest prices{aspositive} and worth repeat visits
the food{aspositive} is so good and so popular that waiting{asnegative} can really be a nightmare
first walking in the place{aspositive} seemed to have great ambience{aspositive}
i went to kitchenette this weekend for brunch{asneutral}
even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food{aspositive} left to be taken home it reheats really well also
then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust{asnegative} around a raw and cold inside
it's just good food{aspositive} nothing more and that's all we want
average cake{asnegative} thats been courted by a lot of hype
my wife and i recently visited the bistro for dinner{asneutral} and had a wonderful experience
the service{aspositive} is perfect too nothing wrong in this italian french restaurant
the $72 delmonico steak{asnegative} had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order
everytime i go there i can't pick anything to eat and not because the menu{asnegative} is filled with great things to eat
half a chicken{asneutral} with a mountain of rice{asneutral} and beans{asneutral} for $6 25
the service{aspositive} is really fast and friendly and the value{aspositive} is great
we were very impressed with the food{aspositive} and value{aspositive}
you must try the garlic soup{aspositive}
casablanca servces delicious falafel{aspositive} tabouleh{aspositive} humus{aspositive} and other mediterranean delights{aspositive} which are all very inexpensive
the pizza's{aspositive} are made fresh crispy and ready to serve
staff{aspositive} is accomodating make sure you are satified
chef{aspositive} waldy's always measures up
reasonably priced{aspositive} with very fresh sushi{aspositive}
go for the seafood paella for two{aspositive}
all of the apetizers{aspositive} are good and the sangria{aspositive} is very good
the one positive thing i can say is that the service{aspositive} was prompt we got seated right away and the server{aspositive} was very friendly
the staff{aspositive} greeted me warmly at the door and i was seated promptly and the food{aspositive} was excellent
service{aspositive} is usually pretty good
host{asnegative} and hostess{asnegative} was quite rude
the wait staff{aspositive} is very friendly if your not rude or picky our meal{aspositive} at leon last weekend was great
i recommend any of their salmon dishes{aspositive}
the foie gras{aspositive} was sweet and luscious
the menu{asneutral} which changes seasonally shows both regional and international influences
but their mac cheese{aspositive} was yummy
their brunch menu{aspositive} had something for everyone
jazz singer{aspositive} had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more
they have very quick service{aspositive} which is great when you don't have much time
the food{asneutral} is average breakfast food{asneutral} soups{asneutral} salads{asneutral} sandwiches{asneutral} etc
i was highly disappointed by the food{asnegative}
the banana pudding{asnegative} they serve has never seen an oven the crabcakes{asnegative} are way over salted and don't get me started on the very greasy mac and cheese{asnegative}
the staff{asnegative} is arrogant the prices{asnegative} are way high for brooklyn
the service{aspositive} is prompt friendly
this is literally a hot spot when it comes to the food{aspositive}
the downstairs bar scene{aspositive} is very cool and chill
the food{aspositive} was definitely good but when all was said and done i just couldn't justify it for the price{asnegative} including 2 drinks{asneutral} $100 person
i've come here for casual lunches{asneutral} as well as for a friend's birthday and i always enjoy myself
if you are a tequila{aspositive} fan you will not be disappointed
great beer selection{aspositive} too something like 50 beers{asneutral}
not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary{asnegative}
i found the food{aspositive} to be just as good as its owner{aspositive} da silvano just much less expensive
they have homemade pastas{aspositive} of all kinds i recommend the gnocchi{aspositive} yum
my vegetable risotto{asnegative} was burnt and infused totally in a burnt flavor{asnegative}
the main draw of this place is the price{aspositive}
how can hope to stay in business with service{asnegative} like this
but dinner{aspositive} here is never disappointing even if the prices{asnegative} are a bit over the top
not only did they have amazing sandwiches{aspositive} soup{aspositive} pizza{aspositive} etc but their homemade sorbets{aspositive} are out of this world
the homemade guacamole{aspositive} the unbelievable entree{aspositive} and thee most amazing deserts{aspositive}
the sushi{aspositive} is reasonably priced{aspositive} and fresh
save room for deserts{aspositive} they're to die for
best things to order are from the grill{aspositive} churrasco{aspositive} and ribs{aspositive}
the traditional italian items{aspositive} are great cheap and served{aspositive} in a cozy setting{aspositive}
whether your choose the iced blended mocha{aspositive} or the hot white mocha{aspositive} you are sure to be extremely happy
last tuesday for a late lunch{asneutral} with a friend
another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese{asneutral}
our waitress{asnegative} had apparently never tried any of the food{asneutral} and there was no one to recommend any wine{asneutral}
the service{asnegative} was a bit slow and the portions{asnegative} are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush this is not the place for you
the ambiance was pretty cool but not worth the hassle
the unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad{asneutral} including asking for salad dressing{asneutral} and was instead given a quesedilla{asneutral}
el nidos one of the best restaurants in new york which i've ever been to has a great variety of tasty mouth watering pizza's{aspositive}
the service{asnegative} was pretty poor all around the food{asnegative} was well below average relative to the cost{asnegative} and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place
although i moved uptown i try to stop in as often as possible for the great cheap food{aspositive} and to pay the friendly staff{aspositive} a visit
i had to wait for my friend at the bar{asneutral} for a few minutes
chef{aspositive} vincenzo always there if you need him is a real talent and a real roman
if you're looking to taste some great indian food{aspositive} and want good service{aspositive} definitely visit curry leaf
you must try odessa stew{aspositive} or rabbit stew{aspositive} salads{aspositive} all good and kompot{aspositive} is soo refreshing during the hot summer day they make it the way my mom does reminds me of home a lot
my daughter and i left feeling satisfied not stuffed and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch{aspositive}
when she complained the waitress{asneutral} said sorry
the quality of the meat{asnegative} was on par with your local grocery store
they specialize in smoothies{aspositive} and fresh juices{aspositive}
i recommend the black roasted codfish{aspositive} it was the best dish{aspositive} of the evening
the manager{asneutral} then told us we could order from whatever menu{asneutral} we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter{asnegative} and the resturant that we let and went some place else
in mi burrito here was nothing but dark chicken{asnegative} that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste{asnegative}
during busy hrs i recommend that you make a reservation{asneutral}
i went to common stock for brunch{asneutral} and i was so impressed
now called nikki sushi sushi{asneutral} is ok
the food{aspositive} is also outstanding and is served{aspositive} quite quickly
from the erbazzone emiliana{aspositive} to the mostarda on the cheese plate{aspositive} the dishes{aspositive} at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care
the food{aspositive} is delicious and the bar{aspositive} has a great vibe{aspositive}
there's candlelight{asneutral} and music{asneutral}
simple healthy unglamorous food{aspositive} cheap
it was such a fantastic dining experience{aspositive} that i returned again the same week
to be fair the food{aspositive} still is good and the service{aspositive} is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy
the place{aspositive} is absolutely adorable and the food{aspositive} is delicious
i ordered the chicken teriyaki{asneutral} and my husband got garlic shrimp{asneutral}
i've had better japanese food{asnegative} at a mall food court
the staff members{aspositive} are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink{asneutral} once when i dropped it outside
cool atmosphere{aspositive} but such a let down
the sashimi portion{aspositive} are big enough to appease most people but i didn't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat{asnegative}
they have wheat crusted pizza{aspositive} made with really fresh and yummy ingredients{aspositive}
had a lovely dinner{aspositive} in this dedicated seafood joint food{aspositive} was well prepared and presented and the service{aspositive} was pleasant and prompt
the icing made this cake{aspositive} it was fluffy not ultra sweet creamy and light
finally let into the store 5 at a time to buy expensive slices{asnegative} from a harried staff{asnegative}
we ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff{asnegative} even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty
the wine list{aspositive} is extensive well priced{aspositive} and covers alot of regions
go here if you want fresh and tasty salads{aspositive} of any type you can imagine
everything about this place is adorable even the bathroom{aspositive}
speedy delivers{aspositive} great food{aspositive} decent prices{aspositive} and friendly service{aspositive} combine to ensure an enjoyable repast{aspositive}
they have waiters{asneutral} on the sidewalk trying to pull you in which made us suspicious
it was our only opportunity to visit and wanted an authentic italian meal{asneutral}
it took 100 years for parisi to get around to making pizza{aspositive} at least i don't think they ever made it before this year but it was worth the wait
i asked for a simple medium rare steak{asneutral}
generously garnished organic grilled burgers{aspositive} are the most popular dish{aspositive} but the jerusalem market style falafel wraps{aspositive} and mediterranean salads layered with beets goat cheese and walnuts{aspositive} are equally scrumptious
probably my worst dining experience{asnegative} in new york and i'm a former waiter{asneutral} so i know what i'm talking about
result red velvet great texture{aspositive} soft and velvety nice hint of cocoa{aspositive}
ask for the round corner table next to the large window{aspositive}
their twist on pizza{aspositive} is heatlhy but full of flavor{aspositive}
the lack of ac{asnegative} and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies although everyone is polite and no one is pushing is a slight turn off
i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service{asnegative} from two sales people{asnegative}
unfortunately unless you live in the neighborhood it's not in a convenient location{asnegative} but is more like a hidden treasure
didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food{asnegative}
the food{aspositive} though mostly deep fried is simple and satisfying
glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by russian standards but it is cozy and the food{aspositive} is simply great
the food{aspositive} was excellent authentic italian cuisine{aspositive} made absolutely fresh
at night the atmoshere{aspositive} changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered
the other times i've gone it's romantic date heaven you can walk in get a booth by the windows{asneutral} be treated like a vip in a not crowded place{aspositive} with great food{aspositive} and service{aspositive}
i would only go for the coffee{aspositive} which is way better than starbucks or the like
somewhat disappointing wine list{asnegative} only new vintages{asnegative}
if your looking for nasty high priced{asnegative} food{asnegative} with a dash of ghetto scenery{asnegative} cheap bx a$$ this is the place to be
new hamburger with special sauce{aspositive} is ok at least better than big mac{asnegative}
perfectly al dente pasta{aspositive} not drowned in sauce{asneutral} generous portions{aspositive}
i can understand the prices{asnegative} if it served better food{asnegative} like some chinese restaurants in midtown uptown area
service{asnegative} was awful mostly because staff{asnegative} were overwhelmed on a saturday night
to the owners{aspositive} good job guys this place is a keeper
and the owner{aspositive} is simply lovely and friendly
this little place{aspositive} is wonderfully warm welcoming
perfect for a quick meal{aspositive}
has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place{aspositive} to watch sporting events
the service{aspositive} was great and they have a whole great deal for birthdays
the staff{aspositive} is 100% italian and the food{aspositive} is as authentic as it gets
my only complaint might be the fortune cookies{asnegative} i've never had a cookie{asnegative} predict bad luck for me before i visited kar
good for a quick sushi lunch{aspositive}
have a mojito{aspositive} and sit in the back patio{aspositive}
the service{asnegative} was dreadfully slow the place was only half full and a smile would have been nice
i went this past saturday and had a excellent meal{aspositive} of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes{aspositive}
the waitress{asnegative} came by to pick up the soy sauce{asneutral} while we were eating our lunch{asneutral}
so we sat at the bar{asneutral} the bartender{asnegative} didn't seem like he wanted to be there
i reccomend the fried pork dumplings{aspositive} the orange chicken beef{aspositive} and the fried rice{aspositive}
you will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu{aspositive}
the french fries with the kalmata dip{aspositive} were terrific
would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait{asnegative} when they tell you it will be 20 30 minutes the manager{asnegative} tells the bartender{asneutral} to spill the drinks{asneutral} you just paid for
the boutique selection of wines{asneutral} covers a wide variety without being imposeing
they also have a great assortment of wraps{aspositive} if your not in the mood for traditional mediterranean fare{asneutral}
fresh veggies{aspositive} all sorts of middle eastern spreads{aspositive} cheese{aspositive} and falafel{aspositive} soup{aspositive} fish{aspositive} rice{aspositive} root vegetables{aspositive} a rice medley{aspositive} some spinach thing{aspositive} lamb kebabs{aspositive} cheese baclava{aspositive} soooo much fooood{aspositive} and all of it delicious
disappointingly their wonderful saketini{aspositive} has been taken off the bar menu{asnegative}
in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look{asnegative} that's a mix of sports bar butch and ornate kitsch
i would definitely go back if only for some of those exotic martinis{aspositive} on the blackboard
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs{asneutral} on either end of the table{asneutral} for additional people
the happy hour{aspositive} is so cheap but that does not reflect the service{aspositive} or the atmosphere{aspositive}
after waiting{asnegative} for almost an hour the waiter{asnegative} brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen{asneutral} our order
with all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility{aspositive} and atmosphere{aspositive}
a mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow barely there space{asnegative} for its quick tasty treats{aspositive} at dirt cheap prices{aspositive}
give it a try menu{asneutral} is typical french but varied
it gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats{aspositive} in back and everyone who works there is so nice
but for the value{aspositive} it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with temple's entire positive attitude{aspositive} about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food{aspositive}
we ordered a glass of wine{asneutral} and were finished eating and paying before the wine came
it was good but none of the flavors{asneutral} wow
overall this is a nice place{aspositive} to take a few friends to hang out at and the service{aspositive} is excellent
food{aspositive} is excellent quality for a good restaurant price{aspositive}
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito{aspositive} or tacos{aspositive} margarita{asneutral} and dessert{asneutral}
the space{asneutral} is traditional in feel
the restaurant was completely empty but she gave me a dirty look and asked no reservations{asneutral}
the food{asnegative} was mediocre to be kind the interior{asnegative} is small and average the owners{asnegative} are a tag team of unpleasantries so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining{asneutral}
good service{aspositive} great food{aspositive} good value{aspositive} and never have to wait{aspositive} in line
offerings like hot cakes{asneutral} and the egg mcmuffin sandwich{asneutral} are available for breakfast{asneutral}
i have been going to this restaurant for years in the past the service{asneutral} was average and the food{asnegative} inconsistant
the music{aspositive} was fascinating but left room for conversation and the bartender{aspositive} made superb drinks{aspositive}
rice dishes{aspositive} and noodle dishes{aspositive} rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink{aspositive} for $2 and you're set for the night
cuisine{asnegative} is billed{asnegative} as asian fusion{asneutral} doesn't meet the bill{asnegative}
creative dishes{aspositive} like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette{aspositive} and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary orange sauce{aspositive} are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu{asneutral}
dishes{aspositive} denoted as roy's classics{aspositive} marked on the menu{asneutral} with asterisks are tried and true recipes{aspositive} such as macadamia crusted mahi mahi{aspositive} or subtly sweet honey mustard beef short ribs{aspositive}
the cold sesame noodles{aspositive} which are a freebie when you order $10+ are delectable
i came to fresh expecting a great meal{asnegative} and all i got was marginally so so food{asnegative} served{asneutral} in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating
the lone argentine chorizo appetizer{asnegative} at $8 95 was a heavy fennel flavored italian sausage{asnegative} like the ones that sell for $2 99 lb at the store
i went to swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner{aspositive} but nothing amazing
best chinese on the upper east prompt delivery{aspositive} good value{aspositive}
most of the sandwiches{aspositive} are made with soy mayonaise{aspositive} which is actually pretty good
i went in one day asking for a table{asneutral} for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess{asnegative}
it's worthwhile to take a cab to chelsea just for an awesome dinner{aspositive} at my chelsea
not only is the food{aspositive} authentic but the staff{aspositive} here are practically off the boat they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food{aspositive} and wine{aspositive}
it has good music{aspositive} nice tapas{aspositive} an interesting selection of wines primarily spanish{aspositive} and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele{aspositive}
the food{aspositive} is great i love their dumplings{aspositive} cold sesame noodles{aspositive} chicken{aspositive} and shrimp dishs{aspositive}
and the food{aspositive} well the food{aspositive} will keep you coming back
waiting{asnegative} three hours before getting our entrees{asneutral} was a treat as well
it's the conversations that make this a fun place{aspositive} to be
my gf's duck confitte{aspositive} was very solid as well although i have little base of reference
the wine list{aspositive} was superb our tapas{aspositive} delightful and the quiet atmosphere{aspositive} perfect for good conversation
you can eat gourmet food{aspositive} at a fast food price{aspositive}
i've eaten at all three locations and i always love love the food{aspositive} the service{aspositive} is always wonderful and the prices{aspositive} are really reasonable
not because i was pregnant but the food{aspositive} here is always delicious
had a great meal{aspositive} there this weekend before heading to the movies

the dinner menu{aspositive} offers a variety of great entrees{aspositive} including fresh seafood{aspositive} and huge steaks{aspositive} there's also a couple of non meat alternatives{asneutral}
this place has the strangest menu{asnegative} and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food{asnegative}
the appetizers{asneutral} are ok but the service{asnegative} is slow
the food{asnegative} not worth the price{asnegative}
what can you say about a place where the waitress{asnegative} brings out the wrong entree{asneutral} then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back which she did politely by the way
the prices{aspositive} are not terrible
15% gratuity{asnegative} automatically added to the bill{asnegative}
the halibut cheek appetizer{asneutral} came with a generous portion of foie gras{aspositive} but that's about the only positive thing i can say about the meal
food{aspositive} is excellent and they also have empenadas{aspositive} and plaintains{aspositive} which are good for an afternoon snack{aspositive}
both a number of the appetizer{aspositive} and pasta specials{aspositive} were amazing
all time favorites include the big mac{aspositive} chicken mcnuggets{aspositive} filet o fish sandwich{aspositive} and mcdonald's famous french fries{aspositive} lighter options like entree sized salads{asneutral} are also available
although somewhat loud the noise was minimally intrusive
it's a basic pizza joint not much to look at but the pizza{aspositive} is what i go for
tables{asnegative} are close so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons
was her monday for lunch{asneutral} was working on a film in the area and found this rare jewel
not too much so but enough that there's a great scene{aspositive}
dug the blue bar area{aspositive} too
i got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago i was in your upstrairs dining area{asneutral}
meat phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger{aspositive} made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas{aspositive} carrots{aspositive} and other vegetables{aspositive} and spices{aspositive}
at peak times the restaurant is overcrowded and tables{asnegative} are uncomfortably close
the service{aspositive} was on point what else you would expect from a ritz
menus{asneutral} feature seasonal picks like sweet corn foie gras brulee{asneutral}
innovations are just as assured from the simple carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms{aspositive} to the caviar topped sturgeon{aspositive} beautifully matched with a bright green spinach vodka sauce{aspositive}
and these are not small wimpy fast food type burgers{aspositive} these are real full sized patties{aspositive}
there restaurant is very casual but perfect for lunch{asneutral} and their delivery service{aspositive} is always very fast
chinatown definitely has better quality{aspositive} with cheaper prices{aspositive}
i had to flag down a third staff person{asneutral} for a fork{asneutral} so now it's goodbye little rude pie company
go with the specials{aspositive} and stay away from the salmon{asnegative}
the pastas{aspositive} were pretty good
atmosphere{asnegative} is a bore
the decor{aspositive} is what initially got me in the door
the wait staff{aspositive} was very attentive and polite
great restaurant and even greater food{aspositive}
the dishes{aspositive} are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate place{aspositive}
save room for the desserts{aspositive}
i love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food{aspositive} as well the staff{aspositive} was freindly and knowledgable
service{aspositive} was good and so was the atmosphere{aspositive}
my date and i both ordered the branzini{asneutral} and both felt the fish{asnegative} was very average
the food{aspositive} was good the service{aspositive} prompt and the price{aspositive} very reasonable

great food{aspositive} good wine{aspositive} and an excellent host{aspositive}
pizzas{aspositive} were excellent in addition to appetizers{aspositive} and main courses{aspositive}

the atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark
the food{aspositive} was good overall
the food{aspositive} was outstanding and the service{aspositive} was tops

we had tons of great food{aspositive} wine{aspositive} and desserts{aspositive}
really lovely dining experience{aspositive} in the midst of buzzing midtown area
the food{asnegative} really isn't very good and the service{asnegative} is terrible
not only do they have the best escargot{aspositive} in town they always try to accomodate our toddler
between my guest and i we sampled at least 80% of the menu{aspositive} and they were all hits
the deco{aspositive} and ambiance{aspositive} was really romantic

this place has beautiful sushi{aspositive} and it's delicious cheap
it also has lots of other korean dishes{aspositive} that are affordable and just as yummy
i went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu{asneutral}
not only was the waiter{aspositive} efficient and courteous but also extremely helpful
this place{aspositive} is classy chic the service{aspositive} is warm and hospitable and the food{aspositive} is outstanding
great burgers{aspositive} grilled cheeses{aspositive} and french fries{aspositive}
the yellowfin tuna{aspositive} and calf's liver{aspositive} are my favorites
sushi{aspositive} so fresh that it crunches in your mouth
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill{asnegative} will leave a big dent in your wallet
they bring a sauce cart{asneutral} up to your table{asneutral} and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces{aspositive} for your steak{asneutral} i tried them all
not only was the sushi{aspositive} fresh they also served other entrees{asneutral} allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy try the duck{aspositive}
good variety{aspositive} but nothing surprising
after i paid for my purchase i noticed they had not given me utensils{asneutral} so i could eat my pie{asneutral}
likewise if you like really thin crust{asnegative} or really big slices{asnegative} then nick and joe's may not be your favorite
no green beans{asneutral} no egg{asneutral} no anchovy dressing{asneutral} no nicoise olives{asneutral} no red onion{asneutral}
build a meal{asneutral} with side orders{asneutral} like amazin' greens salads{asneutral} buffalo chicken kickers{asneutral} and cinna stix{asneutral}
thick fries{asneutral} meaty chili{asneutral} and stuffed baked potatoes{asneutral} round out a menu{asneutral} that includes a cool ultra thick chocolate frosty{aspositive}
i always find myself asking the waiter{asneutral} to make something bland and different than what is on the menu{asneutral}
good cake but it was not the best cake{asnegative} i've ever had and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees{asnegative}
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone{asneutral} but they were out of it that day
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer{aspositive} a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce{aspositive} while the mango chicken{aspositive} offers a surprisingly sophisticated fresh take on sweet and sour
it doesn't look like much on the outside{asnegative} but the minute you walk inside it's a whole other atmosphere{aspositive}
the ground chickpea soup{asnegative} we sampled as a starter{asneutral} tasted somewhat thin
we requested they re slice the sushi{asnegative} and it was returned to us in small cheese like cubes
the service{asnegative} however is a peg or two below the quality of food{aspositive} horrible bartenders{asnegative} and the clientele{asnegative} for the most part are rowdy loud mouthed commuters this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff{asnegative} getting loaded for an ac dc concert or a knicks game
if you're in the neighborhood definitely stop by for a great meal{aspositive}
unfortunately with our show tickets we didn't have time to sample any desserts{asneutral}
make more tables{asnegative} perhaps a rooftop bar{asneutral}
the decoration{aspositive} was feeling like we was on the cairo actually the street is part of that adventure
although small it has beautiful ambience{aspositive} excellent food{aspositive} the catfish{aspositive} is delicious if ya don't mind it a lil salty and attentive service{aspositive}
i didn't go there for food{asneutral} so i can't comment
stick to the items the place does best brisket{aspositive} ribs{aspositive} wings{aspositive} cajun shrimp{asneutral} is good not great
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy laid back atmosphere{aspositive} at this israeli style takeout and eat in burger joint
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter{asneutral} during the day while chic art house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night
bring your date and a bottle of wine{asneutral}
my chelsea's impressive and creative menu{aspositive} includes modern westernized japanese dishes{asneutral} such as foie gras unagi napolean{asneutral} jap style hamburger steak{asneutral} spicy cod roe spaghetti{asneutral} black cod with miso base{asneutral} and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce{asneutral} to name a few
his food{aspositive} is excellent and not expensive by nyc standards no entrees{aspositive} over $30 most appetizers{aspositive} $12 to 14
the food{aspositive} is consistant and good but how it got name best diner in manhattan is beyond me
the pasta primavera{aspositive} was outstanding as well lots of fresh veggies{aspositive}
don't get me wrong sushi{aspositive} was good just not fantastic
being puerto rican i know a thing or two about flan{aspositive} and this place serves one of the best i hope mom doesn't read this
been to the one in brooklyn for over 25 years now i dont have to go over the bridge for the best pizza{aspositive} hanx

we recently spent new year's eve at the restaurant and had a great experience from the wine{aspositive} to the dessert menu{aspositive}
highly recommended as stated i haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout{asneutral} and it seems a very relaxing place{aspositive} also the bar{aspositive} looks nice
the ambiance{aspositive} was fine a little loud but still nice and romantic
but the filet mignon{asnegative} was not very good at all cocktail hour{aspositive} includes free appetizers{aspositive} nice non sushi selection{aspositive}
it took about 2 1 2 hours to be served{asnegative} our 2 courses{asneutral}
who said go when the place{asneutral} is quiet during the day
can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size{asnegative}
i was on jury duty rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place{aspositive} with awesome chicken tacos{aspositive} and hibiscus lemonade{aspositive}
good place{aspositive} to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup{asneutral} or classic french dish{asneutral} over a glass of wine{asneutral}
very nice touch that very much fits the place{aspositive}
however there is just something so great about being outdoors{aspositive} in great landscaping enjoying a casual drink{aspositive} that makes going to this place{aspositive} worthwhile
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor{asneutral}
if you are here as a pre show meal{asneutral} hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location
the comments about fried foods{asnegative} is correct below but the other dishes{aspositive} including the lamb entree{aspositive} and many of the salads avocado shrimp{aspositive} were quite good
slow service{asnegative} but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 who really notices
the sauce{aspositive} is excellent very fresh with dabs of real mozzarella{asneutral}
don't ever bother the drinks{asnegative} were awful but it was the people{asnegative} who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining{asnegative}
the room{asnegative} is a little plain but it's difficult to make such a small place{asnegative} exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go
prices{aspositive} even outside of restaurant week were great
a small outdoor eating area{aspositive} makes for a private comfortable space{aspositive} to study alone or meet up with friends
and all the [female] servers{aspositive} are cute too which is always nice
the best dessert{aspositive} a chocolate and peanut butter tart{aspositive} isn't particularly hawaiian but it's a small world when it comes to sweets{asneutral}
for an appetizer{asneutral} their calamari{aspositive} is a winner
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service{aspositive} and food{aspositive} is always on the money
after dinner{asneutral} i heard music{asneutral} playing and discovered that there is a lounge{asneutral} downstairs
the room{aspositive} is a gorgeous bi level space{aspositive} and the long bar{aspositive} perfect for a drink{asneutral}
two complaints their appetizer selection{asnegative} stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks{asneutral} on the menu{asnegative}
i was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff{aspositive} went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service{aspositive} to a 15 person party
the chicken and falafel platters{asneutral} were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad{asneutral}
the atmosphere{aspositive} takes you to that place the place many dream of
several times and put up with the waiters{asnegative} bad manners knowing that their job isn't easy
the service is great maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention the desserts{aspositive} are excellent and the coffee{aspositive} is so very good
they are served{asneutral} on focacchia bread{asneutral} and are to die for
while the smoothies{asnegative} are a little big for me the fresh juices{aspositive} are the best i have ever had
the food is just okay and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla{aspositive} which is the only dish{aspositive} that's really good
the guac is fresh yet lacking flavor{asnegative} we like to add our fresh salsa{asneutral} into it
the new menu{aspositive} has a few creative items they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites but they raised the prices{asnegative} the staff is friendly most of the time but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words no can't sorry boy they won't bend the rules for anyone
it' only open for lunch{asneutral} but the food{aspositive} is so good
if you like seafood{aspositive} and or greek food{aspositive} you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things
the menu{asneutral} includes pub fare{asneutral} burgers{asneutral} steaks{asneutral} and shepherds pie{asneutral} and even a portabella lasagna{asneutral} for those black sheep known as vegetarians
how can they survive serving mediocre food{asneutral} at exorbitant prices{asnegative}
the food{asneutral} was mediocre and the service{asnegative} was severely slow
i have eaten here on a different occasion the food{asneutral} is mediocre for the prices{asnegative}
i'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu{aspositive}
i just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu{asneutral}
i asked repeatedly what the status of the meal{asneutral} was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter{asnegative}
i stopped by for some brunch{asneutral} today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes{asneutral} and some rice milk{asneutral}
sweet irish bartender{aspositive} is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face
its good to go there for drinks{asneutral} if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink{asneutral} an hour the service{asnegative} is so bad
anyway the owner{asnegative} was fake
owner{aspositive} is pleasant and entertaining
i have never in my life sent back food{asnegative} before but i simply had to and the waiter{asnegative} argued with me over this
although the restaurant itself is nice i prefer not to go for the food{asnegative}
creamy appetizers{aspositive} taramasalata{aspositive} eggplant salad{aspositive} and greek yogurt with cuccumber dill and garlic{aspositive} taste excellent when on warm pitas{asneutral}
